So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55

{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So

{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18
Right, so why you can't we can't what.
{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.

Okay, I will I will people should I repeat what I said.
{Agent} - 07:26

{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.

Oh, I'm sorry, if I'm sorry, I am listening to you and I'm not interrupting you and sorry. If you are if you are going if you are going to refer to me in that manner. I will sorry you are talking over the top of me and if you are going to refer to me and that sort of match the matter I will have to terminate this call.
{Caller} - 10:10
You want us you keep interrupting.
{Caller} - 10:23
Take your name please.
{Agent} - 10:24
I do not take that sort of response to that sort of communication back. I am trying to help you here and I am giving you the options of how I'm going to send the claim form through to you.
{Caller} - 10:32

Yes, good morning yesterday, I reported an emergency issue on the road. I requested claim form, but unfortunately case you couldn't find any record of works be on the on the roof. I was given a reference number and told to call back today, because you could send an email to investigate. The fact they find out what was going on. I wanted to confirm if you have any updates yes.
{Agent} - 00:37
Right do you have a reference number for that at all.
{Caller} - 00:40
Yes, it's 707192.
{Agent} - 00:43

Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.

{Agent} - 01:38
Okay, so if you let me just have a look here.
{Agent} - 01:54
Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council. If you are if you are requesting a claim then obviously I can put that we can send you a claim form out you have read about you have gone onto the website on the claim for damages and you have read about the highways act on there. Now affects your claim.
{Caller} - 05:03
Willing to send the internet council Oliver.

{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18
Right, so why you can't we can't what.
{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.
{Agent} - 07:09
Right. Okay, so you have a really bad line. I do apologise is I can't hear you very very clearly I did get some of that we can send out a claims form.
{Caller} - 07:18
Can you hear me now?
{Agent} - 07:19

Okay, I will I will people should I repeat what I said.
{Agent} - 07:26

{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.

Good morning. Shawn speaking, how can I help you.
{Caller} - 00:06
Yes, good morning yesterday, I reported an emergency issue on the road. I requested claim form, but unfortunately case you couldn't find any record of works be on the on the roof. I was given a reference number and told to call back today, because you could send an email to investigate. The fact they find out what was going on. I wanted to confirm if you have any updates yes.
{Agent} - 00:37
Right do you have a reference number for that at all.
{Caller} - 00:40
Yes, it's 707192.
{Agent} - 00:43

Bravo alpha 2 2 5 delta delta.
{Agent} - 01:38
Okay, so if you let me just have a look here.
{Agent} - 01:54
Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council. If you are if you are requesting a claim then obviously I can put that we can send you a claim form out you have read about you have gone onto the website on the claim for damages and you have read about the highways act on there. Now affects your claim.
{Caller} - 05:03
Willing to send the internet council Oliver.
{Caller} - 05:28
Affect my claim.
{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18
Right, so why you can't we can't what.
{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.
{Agent} - 07:09
Right. Okay, so you have a really bad line. I do apologise is I can't hear you very very clearly I did get some of that we can send out a claims form.
{Caller} - 07:18
Can you hear me now?
{Agent} - 07:19
I can hear you better now obviously with the situation is a day.
{Caller} - 07:22
Okay, I will I will people should I repeat what I said.
{Agent} - 07:26
Yes, if you want to repeat it please yes.
{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.
{Caller} - 09:06
Okay, and well, I don't have access to email. So what reason adjustments can they make because of that.
{Agent} - 09:12
Alright, so you have provided us with an email address for that to be sent out to you.
{Caller} - 09:17

Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.

{Agent} - 09:12
Alright, so you have provided us with an email address for that to be sent out to you.
{Caller} - 09:17

I will sorry you are talking over the top of me and if you are going to refer to me and that sort of match the matter I will have to terminate this call.
{Caller} - 10:10
You want us you keep interrupting.
{Caller} - 10:23
Take your name please.
{Agent} - 10:24
I do not take that sort of response to that sort of communication back. I am trying to help you here and I am giving you the options of how I'm going to send the claim form through to you.
{Caller} - 10:32
Can you hear me?00:02
Good morning. Shawn speaking, how can I help you.
{Caller} - 00:06
Yes, good morning yesterday, I reported an emergency issue on the road. I requested claim form, but unfortunately case you couldn't find any record of works be on the on the roof. I was given a reference number and told to call back today, because you could send an email to investigate. The fact they find out what was going on. I wanted to confirm if you have any updates yes.
{Agent} - 00:37
Right do you have a reference number for that at all.
{Caller} - 00:40
Yes, it's 707192.
{Agent} - 00:43
707.
{Agent} - 00:51
707192.
{Agent} - 01:07
Can you confirm your name please?
{Caller} - 01:09
Ian Palmer.
{Agent} - 01:11
Okay, and your post code.
{Caller} - 01:14
Bravo alpha 2 2 5 delta delta.
{Agent} - 01:38
Okay, so if you let me just have a look here.
{Agent} - 01:54
Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council. If you are if you are requesting a claim then obviously I can put that we can send you a claim form out you have read about you have gone onto the website on the claim for damages and you have read about the highways act on there. Now affects your claim.
{Caller} - 05:03
Willing to send the internet council Oliver.
{Caller} - 05:28
Affect my claim.
{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10

{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18

{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.

When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18
Right, so why you can't we can't what.

{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.
{Agent} - 07:09
Right. Okay, so you have a really bad line. I do apologise is I can't hear you very very clearly I did get some of that we can send out a claims form.
{Caller} - 07:18
Can you hear me now?
{Agent} - 07:19

{Caller} - 07:22
Okay, I will I will people should I repeat what I said.
{Agent} - 07:26
Yes, if you want to repeat it please yes.
{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.
{Caller} - 09:06
Okay, and well, I don't have access to email. So what reason adjustments can they make because of that.
{Agent} - 09:12
Alright, so you have provided us with an email address for that to be sent out to you.
{Caller} - 09:17
As I said I'm a phone call yesterday again, which is recorded for training the marketing purposes. I said I do not have access to that email apart from once a week when my carer available and I put on there. That my junior case.
{Agent} - 09:28
Right, so it can be posted out to you for you to be able to see it can be posted out to you to which which case it would be if he is posted out to you then it'll be posted to your home address.

{Agent} - 10:03
Oh, I'm sorry, if I'm sorry, I am listening to you and I'm not interrupting you and sorry. If you are if you are going if you are going to refer to me in that manner. I will sorry you are talking over the top of me and if you are going to refer to me and that sort of match the matter I will have to terminate this call.
{Caller} - 10:10
You want us you keep interrupting.
{Caller} - 10:23
Take your name please.
{Agent} - 10:24
I do not take that sort of response to that sort of communication back. I am trying to help you here and I am giving you the options of how I'm going to send the claim form through to you.
{Caller} - 10:32
Can you hear me?00:02
Good morning. Shawn speaking, how can I help you.
{Caller} - 00:06
Yes, good morning yesterday, I reported an emergency issue on the road. I requested claim form, but unfortunately case you couldn't find any record of works be on the on the roof. I was given a reference number and told to call back today, because you could send an email to investigate. The fact they find out what was going on. I wanted to confirm if you have any updates yes.
{Agent} - 00:37
Right do you have a reference number for that at all.
{Caller} - 00:40
Yes, it's 707192.
{Agent} - 00:43
707.
{Agent} - 00:51
707192.
{Agent} - 01:07
Can you confirm your name please?
{Caller} - 01:09
Ian Palmer.
{Agent} - 01:11
Okay, and your post code.
{Caller} - 01:14
Bravo alpha 2 2 5 delta delta.
{Agent} - 01:38
Okay, so if you let me just have a look here.
{Agent} - 01:54
Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03

Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03

Now affects your claim.

{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18
Right, so why you can't we can't what.
{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.
{Agent} - 07:09
Right. Okay, so you have a really bad line. I do apologise is I can't hear you very very clearly I did get some of that we can send out a claims form.
{Caller} - 07:18
Can you hear me now?
{Agent} - 07:19

{Caller} - 07:22
Okay, I will I will people should I repeat what I said.
{Agent} - 07:26
Yes, if you want to repeat it please yes.
{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.
{Caller} - 09:06
Okay, and well, I don't have access to email. So what reason adjustments can they make because of that.
{Agent} - 09:12
Alright, so you have provided us with an email address for that to be sent out to you.
{Caller} - 09:17
As I said I'm a phone call yesterday again, which is recorded for training the marketing purposes. I said I do not have access to that email apart from once a week when my carer available and I put on there. That my junior case.
{Agent} - 09:28
Right, so it can be posted out to you for you to be able to see it can be posted out to you to which which case it would be if he is posted out to you then it'll be posted to your home address.
{Caller} - 09:40

{Agent} - 09:44
I'm sorry, yes, I can hear you. Okay. So we are giving you we are giving you the options that you see the post it out to you or if these emailed out to you.
{Caller} - 09:45

Yeah, it's just that it's just that I'm very, sorry, you keep interrupting me and I'm wondering if that's because you can't he really because of the telephone or if it's just because you're being rude, I don't know which one it is.
{Agent} - 10:03
Oh, I'm sorry, if I'm sorry, I am listening to you and I'm not interrupting you and sorry. If you are if you are going if you are going to refer to me in that manner. I will sorry you are talking over the top of me and if you are going to refer to me and that sort of match the matter I will have to terminate this call.
{Caller} - 10:10
You want us you keep interrupting.
{Caller} - 10:23
Take your name please.
{Agent} - 10:24
I do not take that sort of response to that sort of communication back. I am trying to help you here and I am giving you the options of how I'm going to send the claim form through to you.
{Caller} - 10:32
Can you hear me?00:02
Good morning. Shawn speaking, how can I help you.
{Caller} - 00:06
Yes, good morning yesterday, I reported an emergency issue on the road. I requested claim form, but unfortunately case you couldn't find any record of works be on the on the roof. I was given a reference number and told to call back today, because you could send an email to investigate. The fact they find out what was going on. I wanted to confirm if you have any updates yes.
{Agent} - 00:37
Right do you have a reference number for that at all.
{Caller} - 00:40
Yes, it's 707192.
{Agent} - 00:43
707.
{Agent} - 00:51
707192.
{Agent} - 01:07
Can you confirm your name please?
{Caller} - 01:09
Ian Palmer.
{Agent} - 01:11
Okay, and your post code.
{Caller} - 01:14
Bravo alpha 2 2 5 delta delta.
{Agent} - 01:38
Okay, so if you let me just have a look here.
{Agent} - 01:54
Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced.

Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council. If you are if you are requesting a claim then obviously I can put that we can send you a claim form out you have read about you have gone onto the website on the claim for damages and you have read about the highways act on there. Now affects your claim.
{Caller} - 05:03
Willing to send the internet council Oliver.
{Caller} - 05:28
Affect my claim.
{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18
Right, so why you can't we can't what.
{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.
{Agent} - 07:09
Right. Okay, so you have a really bad line. I do apologise is I can't hear you very very clearly I did get some of that we can send out a claims form.
{Caller} - 07:18
Can you hear me now?
{Agent} - 07:19

Okay, I will I will people should I repeat what I said.
{Agent} - 07:26

{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.

{Caller} - 10:32
Can you hear me?00:02
Good morning. Shawn speaking, how can I help you.
{Caller} - 00:06
Yes, good morning yesterday, I reported an emergency issue on the road. I requested claim form, but unfortunately case you couldn't find any record of works be on the on the roof. I was given a reference number and told to call back today, because you could send an email to investigate. The fact they find out what was going on. I wanted to confirm if you have any updates yes.
{Agent} - 00:37
Right do you have a reference number for that at all.
{Caller} - 00:40
Yes, it's 707192.
{Agent} - 00:43
707.
{Agent} - 00:51
707192.
{Agent} - 01:07
Can you confirm your name please?
{Caller} - 01:09
Ian Palmer.
{Agent} - 01:11
Okay, and your post code.
{Caller} - 01:14
Bravo alpha 2 2 5 delta delta.
{Agent} - 01:38
Okay, so if you let me just have a look here.
{Agent} - 01:54
Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council. If you are if you are requesting a claim then obviously I can put that we can send you a claim form out you have read about you have gone onto the website on the claim for damages and you have read about the highways act on there. Now affects your claim.
{Caller} - 05:03
Willing to send the internet council Oliver.
{Caller} - 05:28
Affect my claim.
{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18
Right, so why you can't we can't what.
{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.
{Agent} - 07:09
Right. Okay, so you have a really bad line. I do apologise is I can't hear you very very clearly I did get some of that we can send out a claims form.
{Caller} - 07:18
Can you hear me now?
{Agent} - 07:19
I can hear you better now obviously with the situation is a day.
{Caller} - 07:22
Okay, I will I will people should I repeat what I said.
{Agent} - 07:26
Yes, if you want to repeat it please yes.
{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.
{Caller} - 09:06
Okay, and well, I don't have access to email. So what reason adjustments can they make because of that.
{Agent} - 09:12
Alright, so you have provided us with an email address for that to be sent out to you.
{Caller} - 09:17
As I said I'm a phone call yesterday again, which is recorded for training the marketing purposes. I said I do not have access to that email apart from once a week when my carer available and I put on there. That my junior case.

I will sorry you are talking over the top of me and if you are going to refer to me and that sort of match the matter I will have to terminate this call.
{Caller} - 10:10
You want us you keep interrupting.
{Caller} - 10:23
Take your name please.
{Agent} - 10:24

{Caller} - 10:32
Can you hear me?00:02
Good morning. Shawn speaking, how can I help you.
{Caller} - 00:06
Yes, good morning yesterday, I reported an emergency issue on the road. I requested claim form, but unfortunately case you couldn't find any record of works be on the on the roof. I was given a reference number and told to call back today, because you could send an email to investigate. The fact they find out what was going on. I wanted to confirm if you have any updates yes.
{Agent} - 00:37
Right do you have a reference number for that at all.
{Caller} - 00:40
Yes, it's 707192.
{Agent} - 00:43
707.
{Agent} - 00:51
707192.
{Agent} - 01:07
Can you confirm your name please?
{Caller} - 01:09
Ian Palmer.
{Agent} - 01:11
Okay, and your post code.
{Caller} - 01:14
Bravo alpha 2 2 5 delta delta.
{Agent} - 01:38
Okay, so if you let me just have a look here.
{Agent} - 01:54
Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council. If you are if you are requesting a claim then obviously I can put that we can send you a claim form out you have read about you have gone onto the website on the claim for damages and you have read about the highways act on there. Now affects your claim.
{Caller} - 05:03
Willing to send the internet council Oliver.
{Caller} - 05:28
Affect my claim.
{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18
Right, so why you can't we can't what.
{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.
{Agent} - 07:09
Right. Okay, so you have a really bad line. I do apologise is I can't hear you very very clearly I did get some of that we can send out a claims form.
{Caller} - 07:18
Can you hear me now?
{Agent} - 07:19

{Caller} - 07:22
Okay, I will I will people should I repeat what I said.
{Agent} - 07:26
Yes, if you want to repeat it please yes.
{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there.

Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36

{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.
{Caller} - 09:06
Okay, and well, I don't have access to email. So what reason adjustments can they make because of that.
{Agent} - 09:12
Alright, so you have provided us with an email address for that to be sent out to you.
{Caller} - 09:17
As I said I'm a phone call yesterday again, which is recorded for training the marketing purposes. I said I do not have access to that email apart from once a week when my carer available and I put on there. That my junior case.

Oh, I'm sorry, if I'm sorry, I am listening to you and I'm not interrupting you and sorry. If you are if you are going if you are going to refer to me in that manner. I will sorry you are talking over the top of me and if you are going to refer to me and that sort of match the matter I will have to terminate this call.
{Caller} - 10:10
You want us you keep interrupting.
{Caller} - 10:23
Take your name please.
{Agent} - 10:24
I do not take that sort of response to that sort of communication back. I am trying to help you here and I am giving you the options of how I'm going to send the claim form through to you.
{Caller} - 10:32
Can you hear me?00:02
Good morning. Shawn speaking, how can I help you.
{Caller} - 00:06
Yes, good morning yesterday, I reported an emergency issue on the road. I requested claim form, but unfortunately case you couldn't find any record of works be on the on the roof. I was given a reference number and told to call back today, because you could send an email to investigate. The fact they find out what was going on. I wanted to confirm if you have any updates yes.
{Agent} - 00:37
Right do you have a reference number for that at all.
{Caller} - 00:40
Yes, it's 707192.
{Agent} - 00:43
707.
{Agent} - 00:51
707192.
{Agent} - 01:07
Can you confirm your name please?
{Caller} - 01:09
Ian Palmer.
{Agent} - 01:11
Okay, and your post code.
{Caller} - 01:14
Bravo alpha 2 2 5 delta delta.
{Agent} - 01:38
Okay, so if you let me just have a look here.
{Agent} - 01:54
Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council.

Now affects your claim.
{Caller} - 05:03

{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10

{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18

{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.

If you are if you are requesting a claim then obviously I can put that we can send you a claim form out you have read about you have gone onto the website on the claim for damages and you have read about the highways act on there. Now affects your claim.
{Caller} - 05:03

{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18
Right, so why you can't we can't what.
{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.
{Agent} - 07:09
Right. Okay, so you have a really bad line. I do apologise is I can't hear you very very clearly I did get some of that we can send out a claims form.
{Caller} - 07:18
Can you hear me now?
{Agent} - 07:19
I can hear you better now obviously with the situation is a day.
{Caller} - 07:22
Okay, I will I will people should I repeat what I said.
{Agent} - 07:26
Yes, if you want to repeat it please yes.
{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.
{Caller} - 09:06
Okay, and well, I don't have access to email. So what reason adjustments can they make because of that.
{Agent} - 09:12
Alright, so you have provided us with an email address for that to be sent out to you.
{Caller} - 09:17
As I said I'm a phone call yesterday again, which is recorded for training the marketing purposes. I said I do not have access to that email apart from once a week when my carer available and I put on there. That my junior case.
{Agent} - 09:28
Right, so it can be posted out to you for you to be able to see it can be posted out to you to which which case it would be if he is posted out to you then it'll be posted to your home address.
{Caller} - 09:40
Can you hear me? Okay.
{Agent} - 09:44
I'm sorry, yes, I can hear you. Okay. So we are giving you we are giving you the options that you see the post it out to you or if these emailed out to you.
{Caller} - 09:45
Hello, can you hear me? Okay.
{Caller} - 09:51
Yeah, it's just that it's just that I'm very, sorry, you keep interrupting me and I'm wondering if that's because you can't he really because of the telephone or if it's just because you're being rude, I don't know which one it is.
{Agent} - 10:03
Oh, I'm sorry, if I'm sorry, I am listening to you and I'm not interrupting you and sorry. If you are if you are going if you are going to refer to me in that manner. I will sorry you are talking over the top of me and if you are going to refer to me and that sort of match the matter I will have to terminate this call.
{Caller} - 10:10
You want us you keep interrupting.
{Caller} - 10:23
Take your name please.
{Agent} - 10:24
I do not take that sort of response to that sort of communication back. I am trying to help you here and I am giving you the options of how I'm going to send the claim form through to you.
{Caller} - 10:32
Can you hear me?00:02
Good morning. Shawn speaking, how can I help you.
{Caller} - 00:06
Yes, good morning yesterday, I reported an emergency issue on the road. I requested claim form, but unfortunately case you couldn't find any record of works be on the on the roof. I was given a reference number and told to call back today, because you could send an email to investigate. The fact they find out what was going on. I wanted to confirm if you have any updates yes.
{Agent} - 00:37
Right do you have a reference number for that at all.
{Caller} - 00:40
Yes, it's 707192.
{Agent} - 00:43
707.
{Agent} - 00:51
707192.
{Agent} - 01:07
Can you confirm your name please?
{Caller} - 01:09
Ian Palmer.
{Agent} - 01:11
Okay, and your post code.
{Caller} - 01:14
Bravo alpha 2 2 5 delta delta.
{Agent} - 01:38
Okay, so if you let me just have a look here.
{Agent} - 01:54
Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council.

Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council. If you are if you are requesting a claim then obviously I can put that we can send you a claim form out you have read about you have gone onto the website on the claim for damages and you have read about the highways act on there. Now affects your claim.
{Caller} - 05:03
Willing to send the internet council Oliver.
{Caller} - 05:28
Affect my claim.
{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18
Right, so why you can't we can't what.
{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.
{Agent} - 07:09

{Caller} - 07:18

{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance.

Good morning. Shawn speaking, how can I help you.
{Caller} - 00:06
Yes, good morning yesterday, I reported an emergency issue on the road. I requested claim form, but unfortunately case you couldn't find any record of works be on the on the roof. I was given a reference number and told to call back today, because you could send an email to investigate. The fact they find out what was going on. I wanted to confirm if you have any updates yes.
{Agent} - 00:37
Right do you have a reference number for that at all.
{Caller} - 00:40
Yes, it's 707192.
{Agent} - 00:43

Bravo alpha 2 2 5 delta delta.
{Agent} - 01:38
Okay, so if you let me just have a look here.
{Agent} - 01:54
Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council. If you are if you are requesting a claim then obviously I can put that we can send you a claim form out you have read about you have gone onto the website on the claim for damages and you have read about the highways act on there. Now affects your claim.
{Caller} - 05:03
Willing to send the internet council Oliver.
{Caller} - 05:28
Affect my claim.
{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18
Right, so why you can't we can't what.
{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.
{Agent} - 07:09
Right. Okay, so you have a really bad line. I do apologise is I can't hear you very very clearly I did get some of that we can send out a claims form.
{Caller} - 07:18
Can you hear me now?
{Agent} - 07:19

Okay, I will I will people should I repeat what I said.
{Agent} - 07:26

{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.
{Caller} - 09:06

{Agent} - 09:12

I will sorry you are talking over the top of me and if you are going to refer to me and that sort of match the matter I will have to terminate this call.
{Caller} - 10:10
You want us you keep interrupting.
{Caller} - 10:23

{Caller} - 10:32
Can you hear me?00:02
Good morning. Shawn speaking, how can I help you.
{Caller} - 00:06
Yes, good morning yesterday, I reported an emergency issue on the road. I requested claim form, but unfortunately case you couldn't find any record of works be on the on the roof. I was given a reference number and told to call back today, because you could send an email to investigate. The fact they find out what was going on. I wanted to confirm if you have any updates yes.
{Agent} - 00:37
Right do you have a reference number for that at all.
{Caller} - 00:40
Yes, it's 707192.
{Agent} - 00:43
707.
{Agent} - 00:51
707192.
{Agent} - 01:07
Can you confirm your name please?
{Caller} - 01:09
Ian Palmer.
{Agent} - 01:11
Okay, and your post code.
{Caller} - 01:14
Bravo alpha 2 2 5 delta delta.
{Agent} - 01:38
Okay, so if you let me just have a look here.
{Agent} - 01:54
Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council. If you are if you are requesting a claim then obviously I can put that we can send you a claim form out you have read about you have gone onto the website on the claim for damages and you have read about the highways act on there. Now affects your claim.
{Caller} - 05:03
Willing to send the internet council Oliver.
{Caller} - 05:28
Affect my claim.
{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18
Right, so why you can't we can't what.
{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.
{Agent} - 07:09
Right. Okay, so you have a really bad line. I do apologise is I can't hear you very very clearly I did get some of that we can send out a claims form.
{Caller} - 07:18
Can you hear me now?
{Agent} - 07:19
I can hear you better now obviously with the situation is a day.
{Caller} - 07:22
Okay, I will I will people should I repeat what I said.
{Agent} - 07:26
Yes, if you want to repeat it please yes.
{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.
{Caller} - 09:06
Okay, and well, I don't have access to email. So what reason adjustments can they make because of that.
{Agent} - 09:12
Alright, so you have provided us with an email address for that to be sent out to you.

{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.
{Caller} - 09:06
Okay, and well, I don't have access to email. So what reason adjustments can they make because of that.
{Agent} - 09:12
Alright, so you have provided us with an email address for that to be sent out to you.
{Caller} - 09:17
As I said I'm a phone call yesterday again, which is recorded for training the marketing purposes. I said I do not have access to that email apart from once a week when my carer available and I put on there. That my junior case.
{Agent} - 09:28

Oh, I'm sorry, if I'm sorry, I am listening to you and I'm not interrupting you and sorry. If you are if you are going if you are going to refer to me in that manner. I will sorry you are talking over the top of me and if you are going to refer to me and that sort of match the matter I will have to terminate this call.
{Caller} - 10:10
You want us you keep interrupting.
{Caller} - 10:23
Take your name please.
{Agent} - 10:24
I do not take that sort of response to that sort of communication back. I am trying to help you here and I am giving you the options of how I'm going to send the claim form through to you.
{Caller} - 10:32
Can you hear me?00:02
Good morning. Shawn speaking, how can I help you.
{Caller} - 00:06
Yes, good morning yesterday, I reported an emergency issue on the road. I requested claim form, but unfortunately case you couldn't find any record of works be on the on the roof. I was given a reference number and told to call back today, because you could send an email to investigate. The fact they find out what was going on. I wanted to confirm if you have any updates yes.
{Agent} - 00:37
Right do you have a reference number for that at all.
{Caller} - 00:40
Yes, it's 707192.
{Agent} - 00:43
707.
{Agent} - 00:51
707192.
{Agent} - 01:07
Can you confirm your name please?
{Caller} - 01:09
Ian Palmer.
{Agent} - 01:11
Okay, and your post code.
{Caller} - 01:14
Bravo alpha 2 2 5 delta delta.
{Agent} - 01:38
Okay, so if you let me just have a look here.
{Agent} - 01:54
Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council. If you are if you are requesting a claim then obviously I can put that we can send you a claim form out you have read about you have gone onto the website on the claim for damages and you have read about the highways act on there. Now affects your claim.
{Caller} - 05:03
Willing to send the internet council Oliver.
{Caller} - 05:28
Affect my claim.
{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18

{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.

One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18
Right, so why you can't we can't what.
{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.
{Agent} - 07:09
Right. Okay, so you have a really bad line. I do apologise is I can't hear you very very clearly I did get some of that we can send out a claims form.
{Caller} - 07:18
Can you hear me now?
{Agent} - 07:19
I can hear you better now obviously with the situation is a day.
{Caller} - 07:22
Okay, I will I will people should I repeat what I said.
{Agent} - 07:26
Yes, if you want to repeat it please yes.
{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.
{Caller} - 09:06
Okay, and well, I don't have access to email. So what reason adjustments can they make because of that.
{Agent} - 09:12
Alright, so you have provided us with an email address for that to be sent out to you.
{Caller} - 09:17
As I said I'm a phone call yesterday again, which is recorded for training the marketing purposes. I said I do not have access to that email apart from once a week when my carer available and I put on there. That my junior case.
{Agent} - 09:28
Right, so it can be posted out to you for you to be able to see it can be posted out to you to which which case it would be if he is posted out to you then it'll be posted to your home address.
{Caller} - 09:40

{Agent} - 09:44
I'm sorry, yes, I can hear you. Okay. So we are giving you we are giving you the options that you see the post it out to you or if these emailed out to you.

Yeah, it's just that it's just that I'm very, sorry, you keep interrupting me and I'm wondering if that's because you can't he really because of the telephone or if it's just because you're being rude, I don't know which one it is.
{Agent} - 10:03
Oh, I'm sorry, if I'm sorry, I am listening to you and I'm not interrupting you and sorry. If you are if you are going if you are going to refer to me in that manner. I will sorry you are talking over the top of me and if you are going to refer to me and that sort of match the matter I will have to terminate this call.
{Caller} - 10:10
You want us you keep interrupting.
{Caller} - 10:23
Take your name please.
{Agent} - 10:24
I do not take that sort of response to that sort of communication back. I am trying to help you here and I am giving you the options of how I'm going to send the claim form through to you.
{Caller} - 10:32
Can you hear me?00:02
Good morning. Shawn speaking, how can I help you.
{Caller} - 00:06
Yes, good morning yesterday, I reported an emergency issue on the road. I requested claim form, but unfortunately case you couldn't find any record of works be on the on the roof. I was given a reference number and told to call back today, because you could send an email to investigate. The fact they find out what was going on. I wanted to confirm if you have any updates yes.
{Agent} - 00:37
Right do you have a reference number for that at all.
{Caller} - 00:40
Yes, it's 707192.
{Agent} - 00:43
707.
{Agent} - 00:51
707192.
{Agent} - 01:07
Can you confirm your name please?
{Caller} - 01:09
Ian Palmer.
{Agent} - 01:11
Okay, and your post code.
{Caller} - 01:14
Bravo alpha 2 2 5 delta delta.
{Agent} - 01:38
Okay, so if you let me just have a look here.
{Agent} - 01:54
Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council.

Now affects your claim.

Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council. If you are if you are requesting a claim then obviously I can put that we can send you a claim form out you have read about you have gone onto the website on the claim for damages and you have read about the highways act on there. Now affects your claim.
{Caller} - 05:03
Willing to send the internet council Oliver.
{Caller} - 05:28
Affect my claim.
{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18
Right, so why you can't we can't what.
{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.
{Agent} - 07:09
Right. Okay, so you have a really bad line. I do apologise is I can't hear you very very clearly I did get some of that we can send out a claims form.
{Caller} - 07:18
Can you hear me now?
{Agent} - 07:19
I can hear you better now obviously with the situation is a day.
{Caller} - 07:22
Okay, I will I will people should I repeat what I said.
{Agent} - 07:26
Yes, if you want to repeat it please yes.
{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.
{Caller} - 09:06
Okay, and well, I don't have access to email. So what reason adjustments can they make because of that.
{Agent} - 09:12
Alright, so you have provided us with an email address for that to be sent out to you.
{Caller} - 09:17
As I said I'm a phone call yesterday again, which is recorded for training the marketing purposes. I said I do not have access to that email apart from once a week when my carer available and I put on there. That my junior case.
{Agent} - 09:28
Right, so it can be posted out to you for you to be able to see it can be posted out to you to which which case it would be if he is posted out to you then it'll be posted to your home address.
{Caller} - 09:40

{Agent} - 10:03
Oh, I'm sorry, if I'm sorry, I am listening to you and I'm not interrupting you and sorry. If you are if you are going if you are going to refer to me in that manner. I will sorry you are talking over the top of me and if you are going to refer to me and that sort of match the matter I will have to terminate this call.
{Caller} - 10:10
You want us you keep interrupting.
{Caller} - 10:23
Take your name please.
{Agent} - 10:24
I do not take that sort of response to that sort of communication back. I am trying to help you here and I am giving you the options of how I'm going to send the claim form through to you.
{Caller} - 10:32
Can you hear me?00:02
Good morning. Shawn speaking, how can I help you.
{Caller} - 00:06
Yes, good morning yesterday, I reported an emergency issue on the road. I requested claim form, but unfortunately case you couldn't find any record of works be on the on the roof. I was given a reference number and told to call back today, because you could send an email to investigate. The fact they find out what was going on. I wanted to confirm if you have any updates yes.
{Agent} - 00:37
Right do you have a reference number for that at all.
{Caller} - 00:40
Yes, it's 707192.
{Agent} - 00:43

{Agent} - 01:38
Okay, so if you let me just have a look here.
{Agent} - 01:54
Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.

{Agent} - 01:38
Okay, so if you let me just have a look here.
{Agent} - 01:54
Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council. If you are if you are requesting a claim then obviously I can put that we can send you a claim form out you have read about you have gone onto the website on the claim for damages and you have read about the highways act on there. Now affects your claim.
{Caller} - 05:03
Willing to send the internet council Oliver.
{Caller} - 05:28
Affect my claim.
{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18
Right, so why you can't we can't what.
{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.
{Agent} - 07:09

{Caller} - 07:18

{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.

{Caller} - 10:32
Can you hear me?00:02
Good morning. Shawn speaking, how can I help you.
{Caller} - 00:06
Yes, good morning yesterday, I reported an emergency issue on the road. I requested claim form, but unfortunately case you couldn't find any record of works be on the on the roof. I was given a reference number and told to call back today, because you could send an email to investigate. The fact they find out what was going on. I wanted to confirm if you have any updates yes.
{Agent} - 00:37
Right do you have a reference number for that at all.
{Caller} - 00:40
Yes, it's 707192.
{Agent} - 00:43
707.
{Agent} - 00:51
707192.
{Agent} - 01:07
Can you confirm your name please?
{Caller} - 01:09
Ian Palmer.
{Agent} - 01:11
Okay, and your post code.
{Caller} - 01:14
Bravo alpha 2 2 5 delta delta.
{Agent} - 01:38
Okay, so if you let me just have a look here.
{Agent} - 01:54
Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council. If you are if you are requesting a claim then obviously I can put that we can send you a claim form out you have read about you have gone onto the website on the claim for damages and you have read about the highways act on there. Now affects your claim.
{Caller} - 05:03
Willing to send the internet council Oliver.
{Caller} - 05:28
Affect my claim.
{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18
Right, so why you can't we can't what.
{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.
{Agent} - 07:09
Right. Okay, so you have a really bad line. I do apologise is I can't hear you very very clearly I did get some of that we can send out a claims form.
{Caller} - 07:18
Can you hear me now?
{Agent} - 07:19
I can hear you better now obviously with the situation is a day.
{Caller} - 07:22
Okay, I will I will people should I repeat what I said.
{Agent} - 07:26
Yes, if you want to repeat it please yes.
{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.
{Caller} - 09:06
Okay, and well, I don't have access to email. So what reason adjustments can they make because of that.
{Agent} - 09:12
Alright, so you have provided us with an email address for that to be sent out to you.
{Caller} - 09:17
As I said I'm a phone call yesterday again, which is recorded for training the marketing purposes. I said I do not have access to that email apart from once a week when my carer available and I put on there. That my junior case.

I will sorry you are talking over the top of me and if you are going to refer to me and that sort of match the matter I will have to terminate this call.
{Caller} - 10:10
You want us you keep interrupting.
{Caller} - 10:23
Take your name please.
{Agent} - 10:24

{Caller} - 10:32
Can you hear me?00:02
Good morning. Shawn speaking, how can I help you.
{Caller} - 00:06
Yes, good morning yesterday, I reported an emergency issue on the road. I requested claim form, but unfortunately case you couldn't find any record of works be on the on the roof. I was given a reference number and told to call back today, because you could send an email to investigate. The fact they find out what was going on. I wanted to confirm if you have any updates yes.
{Agent} - 00:37
Right do you have a reference number for that at all.
{Caller} - 00:40
Yes, it's 707192.
{Agent} - 00:43
707.
{Agent} - 00:51
707192.
{Agent} - 01:07
Can you confirm your name please?
{Caller} - 01:09
Ian Palmer.
{Agent} - 01:11
Okay, and your post code.
{Caller} - 01:14
Bravo alpha 2 2 5 delta delta.
{Agent} - 01:38
Okay, so if you let me just have a look here.
{Agent} - 01:54
Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council. If you are if you are requesting a claim then obviously I can put that we can send you a claim form out you have read about you have gone onto the website on the claim for damages and you have read about the highways act on there. Now affects your claim.
{Caller} - 05:03
Willing to send the internet council Oliver.
{Caller} - 05:28
Affect my claim.
{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18
Right, so why you can't we can't what.
{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.
{Agent} - 07:09
Right. Okay, so you have a really bad line. I do apologise is I can't hear you very very clearly I did get some of that we can send out a claims form.
{Caller} - 07:18
Can you hear me now?
{Agent} - 07:19

{Caller} - 07:22
Okay, I will I will people should I repeat what I said.
{Agent} - 07:26
Yes, if you want to repeat it please yes.
{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there.

Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36

{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.
{Caller} - 09:06
Okay, and well, I don't have access to email. So what reason adjustments can they make because of that.
{Agent} - 09:12
Alright, so you have provided us with an email address for that to be sent out to you.
{Caller} - 09:17
As I said I'm a phone call yesterday again, which is recorded for training the marketing purposes. I said I do not have access to that email apart from once a week when my carer available and I put on there. That my junior case.

Oh, I'm sorry, if I'm sorry, I am listening to you and I'm not interrupting you and sorry. If you are if you are going if you are going to refer to me in that manner. I will sorry you are talking over the top of me and if you are going to refer to me and that sort of match the matter I will have to terminate this call.
{Caller} - 10:10
You want us you keep interrupting.
{Caller} - 10:23
Take your name please.
{Agent} - 10:24
I do not take that sort of response to that sort of communication back. I am trying to help you here and I am giving you the options of how I'm going to send the claim form through to you.
{Caller} - 10:32
Can you hear me?00:02
Good morning. Shawn speaking, how can I help you.
{Caller} - 00:06
Yes, good morning yesterday, I reported an emergency issue on the road. I requested claim form, but unfortunately case you couldn't find any record of works be on the on the roof. I was given a reference number and told to call back today, because you could send an email to investigate. The fact they find out what was going on. I wanted to confirm if you have any updates yes.
{Agent} - 00:37
Right do you have a reference number for that at all.
{Caller} - 00:40
Yes, it's 707192.
{Agent} - 00:43
707.
{Agent} - 00:51
707192.
{Agent} - 01:07
Can you confirm your name please?
{Caller} - 01:09
Ian Palmer.
{Agent} - 01:11
Okay, and your post code.
{Caller} - 01:14
Bravo alpha 2 2 5 delta delta.
{Agent} - 01:38
Okay, so if you let me just have a look here.
{Agent} - 01:54
Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council.

Now affects your claim.
{Caller} - 05:03

{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10

{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18

{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.

If you are if you are requesting a claim then obviously I can put that we can send you a claim form out you have read about you have gone onto the website on the claim for damages and you have read about the highways act on there. Now affects your claim.
{Caller} - 05:03

{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18
Right, so why you can't we can't what.
{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.
{Agent} - 07:09
Right. Okay, so you have a really bad line. I do apologise is I can't hear you very very clearly I did get some of that we can send out a claims form.
{Caller} - 07:18
Can you hear me now?
{Agent} - 07:19
I can hear you better now obviously with the situation is a day.
{Caller} - 07:22
Okay, I will I will people should I repeat what I said.
{Agent} - 07:26
Yes, if you want to repeat it please yes.
{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.
{Caller} - 09:06
Okay, and well, I don't have access to email. So what reason adjustments can they make because of that.
{Agent} - 09:12
Alright, so you have provided us with an email address for that to be sent out to you.
{Caller} - 09:17
As I said I'm a phone call yesterday again, which is recorded for training the marketing purposes. I said I do not have access to that email apart from once a week when my carer available and I put on there. That my junior case.
{Agent} - 09:28
Right, so it can be posted out to you for you to be able to see it can be posted out to you to which which case it would be if he is posted out to you then it'll be posted to your home address.
{Caller} - 09:40
Can you hear me? Okay.
{Agent} - 09:44
I'm sorry, yes, I can hear you. Okay. So we are giving you we are giving you the options that you see the post it out to you or if these emailed out to you.
{Caller} - 09:45
Hello, can you hear me? Okay.
{Caller} - 09:51
Yeah, it's just that it's just that I'm very, sorry, you keep interrupting me and I'm wondering if that's because you can't he really because of the telephone or if it's just because you're being rude, I don't know which one it is.
{Agent} - 10:03
Oh, I'm sorry, if I'm sorry, I am listening to you and I'm not interrupting you and sorry. If you are if you are going if you are going to refer to me in that manner. I will sorry you are talking over the top of me and if you are going to refer to me and that sort of match the matter I will have to terminate this call.
{Caller} - 10:10
You want us you keep interrupting.
{Caller} - 10:23
Take your name please.
{Agent} - 10:24
I do not take that sort of response to that sort of communication back. I am trying to help you here and I am giving you the options of how I'm going to send the claim form through to you.
{Caller} - 10:32
Can you hear me?00:02
Good morning. Shawn speaking, how can I help you.
{Caller} - 00:06
Yes, good morning yesterday, I reported an emergency issue on the road. I requested claim form, but unfortunately case you couldn't find any record of works be on the on the roof. I was given a reference number and told to call back today, because you could send an email to investigate. The fact they find out what was going on. I wanted to confirm if you have any updates yes.
{Agent} - 00:37
Right do you have a reference number for that at all.
{Caller} - 00:40
Yes, it's 707192.
{Agent} - 00:43
707.
{Agent} - 00:51
707192.
{Agent} - 01:07
Can you confirm your name please?
{Caller} - 01:09
Ian Palmer.
{Agent} - 01:11
Okay, and your post code.
{Caller} - 01:14
Bravo alpha 2 2 5 delta delta.
{Agent} - 01:38
Okay, so if you let me just have a look here.
{Agent} - 01:54
Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council.

Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council. If you are if you are requesting a claim then obviously I can put that we can send you a claim form out you have read about you have gone onto the website on the claim for damages and you have read about the highways act on there. Now affects your claim.
{Caller} - 05:03
Willing to send the internet council Oliver.
{Caller} - 05:28
Affect my claim.
{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18
Right, so why you can't we can't what.
{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.
{Agent} - 07:09

{Caller} - 07:18

{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance.

Good morning. Shawn speaking, how can I help you.
{Caller} - 00:06
Yes, good morning yesterday, I reported an emergency issue on the road. I requested claim form, but unfortunately case you couldn't find any record of works be on the on the roof. I was given a reference number and told to call back today, because you could send an email to investigate. The fact they find out what was going on. I wanted to confirm if you have any updates yes.
{Agent} - 00:37
Right do you have a reference number for that at all.
{Caller} - 00:40
Yes, it's 707192.
{Agent} - 00:43

Bravo alpha 2 2 5 delta delta.
{Agent} - 01:38
Okay, so if you let me just have a look here.
{Agent} - 01:54
Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council. If you are if you are requesting a claim then obviously I can put that we can send you a claim form out you have read about you have gone onto the website on the claim for damages and you have read about the highways act on there. Now affects your claim.
{Caller} - 05:03
Willing to send the internet council Oliver.
{Caller} - 05:28
Affect my claim.
{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18
Right, so why you can't we can't what.
{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.
{Agent} - 07:09
Right. Okay, so you have a really bad line. I do apologise is I can't hear you very very clearly I did get some of that we can send out a claims form.
{Caller} - 07:18
Can you hear me now?
{Agent} - 07:19

Okay, I will I will people should I repeat what I said.
{Agent} - 07:26

{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.
{Caller} - 09:06

{Agent} - 09:12

I will sorry you are talking over the top of me and if you are going to refer to me and that sort of match the matter I will have to terminate this call.
{Caller} - 10:10
You want us you keep interrupting.
{Caller} - 10:23

{Caller} - 10:32
Can you hear me?00:02
Good morning. Shawn speaking, how can I help you.
{Caller} - 00:06
Yes, good morning yesterday, I reported an emergency issue on the road. I requested claim form, but unfortunately case you couldn't find any record of works be on the on the roof. I was given a reference number and told to call back today, because you could send an email to investigate. The fact they find out what was going on. I wanted to confirm if you have any updates yes.
{Agent} - 00:37
Right do you have a reference number for that at all.
{Caller} - 00:40
Yes, it's 707192.
{Agent} - 00:43
707.
{Agent} - 00:51
707192.
{Agent} - 01:07
Can you confirm your name please?
{Caller} - 01:09
Ian Palmer.
{Agent} - 01:11
Okay, and your post code.
{Caller} - 01:14
Bravo alpha 2 2 5 delta delta.
{Agent} - 01:38
Okay, so if you let me just have a look here.
{Agent} - 01:54
Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council. If you are if you are requesting a claim then obviously I can put that we can send you a claim form out you have read about you have gone onto the website on the claim for damages and you have read about the highways act on there. Now affects your claim.
{Caller} - 05:03
Willing to send the internet council Oliver.
{Caller} - 05:28
Affect my claim.
{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18
Right, so why you can't we can't what.
{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.
{Agent} - 07:09
Right. Okay, so you have a really bad line. I do apologise is I can't hear you very very clearly I did get some of that we can send out a claims form.
{Caller} - 07:18
Can you hear me now?
{Agent} - 07:19
I can hear you better now obviously with the situation is a day.
{Caller} - 07:22
Okay, I will I will people should I repeat what I said.
{Agent} - 07:26
Yes, if you want to repeat it please yes.
{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.
{Caller} - 09:06
Okay, and well, I don't have access to email. So what reason adjustments can they make because of that.
{Agent} - 09:12
Alright, so you have provided us with an email address for that to be sent out to you.

{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.
{Caller} - 09:06
Okay, and well, I don't have access to email. So what reason adjustments can they make because of that.
{Agent} - 09:12
Alright, so you have provided us with an email address for that to be sent out to you.
{Caller} - 09:17
As I said I'm a phone call yesterday again, which is recorded for training the marketing purposes. I said I do not have access to that email apart from once a week when my carer available and I put on there. That my junior case.
{Agent} - 09:28

Oh, I'm sorry, if I'm sorry, I am listening to you and I'm not interrupting you and sorry. If you are if you are going if you are going to refer to me in that manner. I will sorry you are talking over the top of me and if you are going to refer to me and that sort of match the matter I will have to terminate this call.
{Caller} - 10:10
You want us you keep interrupting.
{Caller} - 10:23
Take your name please.
{Agent} - 10:24
I do not take that sort of response to that sort of communication back. I am trying to help you here and I am giving you the options of how I'm going to send the claim form through to you.
{Caller} - 10:32
Can you hear me?00:02
Good morning. Shawn speaking, how can I help you.
{Caller} - 00:06
Yes, good morning yesterday, I reported an emergency issue on the road. I requested claim form, but unfortunately case you couldn't find any record of works be on the on the roof. I was given a reference number and told to call back today, because you could send an email to investigate. The fact they find out what was going on. I wanted to confirm if you have any updates yes.
{Agent} - 00:37
Right do you have a reference number for that at all.
{Caller} - 00:40
Yes, it's 707192.
{Agent} - 00:43
707.
{Agent} - 00:51
707192.
{Agent} - 01:07
Can you confirm your name please?
{Caller} - 01:09
Ian Palmer.
{Agent} - 01:11
Okay, and your post code.
{Caller} - 01:14
Bravo alpha 2 2 5 delta delta.
{Agent} - 01:38
Okay, so if you let me just have a look here.
{Agent} - 01:54
Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council. If you are if you are requesting a claim then obviously I can put that we can send you a claim form out you have read about you have gone onto the website on the claim for damages and you have read about the highways act on there. Now affects your claim.
{Caller} - 05:03
Willing to send the internet council Oliver.
{Caller} - 05:28
Affect my claim.
{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18

{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.

One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18
Right, so why you can't we can't what.
{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.
{Agent} - 07:09
Right. Okay, so you have a really bad line. I do apologise is I can't hear you very very clearly I did get some of that we can send out a claims form.
{Caller} - 07:18
Can you hear me now?
{Agent} - 07:19
I can hear you better now obviously with the situation is a day.
{Caller} - 07:22
Okay, I will I will people should I repeat what I said.
{Agent} - 07:26
Yes, if you want to repeat it please yes.
{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.
{Caller} - 09:06
Okay, and well, I don't have access to email. So what reason adjustments can they make because of that.
{Agent} - 09:12
Alright, so you have provided us with an email address for that to be sent out to you.
{Caller} - 09:17
As I said I'm a phone call yesterday again, which is recorded for training the marketing purposes. I said I do not have access to that email apart from once a week when my carer available and I put on there. That my junior case.
{Agent} - 09:28
Right, so it can be posted out to you for you to be able to see it can be posted out to you to which which case it would be if he is posted out to you then it'll be posted to your home address.
{Caller} - 09:40

{Agent} - 09:44
I'm sorry, yes, I can hear you. Okay. So we are giving you we are giving you the options that you see the post it out to you or if these emailed out to you.

Yeah, it's just that it's just that I'm very, sorry, you keep interrupting me and I'm wondering if that's because you can't he really because of the telephone or if it's just because you're being rude, I don't know which one it is.
{Agent} - 10:03
Oh, I'm sorry, if I'm sorry, I am listening to you and I'm not interrupting you and sorry. If you are if you are going if you are going to refer to me in that manner. I will sorry you are talking over the top of me and if you are going to refer to me and that sort of match the matter I will have to terminate this call.
{Caller} - 10:10
You want us you keep interrupting.
{Caller} - 10:23
Take your name please.
{Agent} - 10:24
I do not take that sort of response to that sort of communication back. I am trying to help you here and I am giving you the options of how I'm going to send the claim form through to you.
{Caller} - 10:32
Can you hear me?00:02
Good morning. Shawn speaking, how can I help you.
{Caller} - 00:06
Yes, good morning yesterday, I reported an emergency issue on the road. I requested claim form, but unfortunately case you couldn't find any record of works be on the on the roof. I was given a reference number and told to call back today, because you could send an email to investigate. The fact they find out what was going on. I wanted to confirm if you have any updates yes.
{Agent} - 00:37
Right do you have a reference number for that at all.
{Caller} - 00:40
Yes, it's 707192.
{Agent} - 00:43
707.
{Agent} - 00:51
707192.
{Agent} - 01:07
Can you confirm your name please?
{Caller} - 01:09
Ian Palmer.
{Agent} - 01:11
Okay, and your post code.
{Caller} - 01:14
Bravo alpha 2 2 5 delta delta.
{Agent} - 01:38
Okay, so if you let me just have a look here.
{Agent} - 01:54
Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council.

Now affects your claim.

Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council. If you are if you are requesting a claim then obviously I can put that we can send you a claim form out you have read about you have gone onto the website on the claim for damages and you have read about the highways act on there. Now affects your claim.
{Caller} - 05:03
Willing to send the internet council Oliver.
{Caller} - 05:28
Affect my claim.
{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18
Right, so why you can't we can't what.
{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.
{Agent} - 07:09
Right. Okay, so you have a really bad line. I do apologise is I can't hear you very very clearly I did get some of that we can send out a claims form.
{Caller} - 07:18
Can you hear me now?
{Agent} - 07:19
I can hear you better now obviously with the situation is a day.
{Caller} - 07:22
Okay, I will I will people should I repeat what I said.
{Agent} - 07:26
Yes, if you want to repeat it please yes.
{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.
{Caller} - 09:06
Okay, and well, I don't have access to email. So what reason adjustments can they make because of that.
{Agent} - 09:12
Alright, so you have provided us with an email address for that to be sent out to you.
{Caller} - 09:17
As I said I'm a phone call yesterday again, which is recorded for training the marketing purposes. I said I do not have access to that email apart from once a week when my carer available and I put on there. That my junior case.
{Agent} - 09:28
Right, so it can be posted out to you for you to be able to see it can be posted out to you to which which case it would be if he is posted out to you then it'll be posted to your home address.
{Caller} - 09:40

{Agent} - 10:03
Oh, I'm sorry, if I'm sorry, I am listening to you and I'm not interrupting you and sorry. If you are if you are going if you are going to refer to me in that manner. I will sorry you are talking over the top of me and if you are going to refer to me and that sort of match the matter I will have to terminate this call.
{Caller} - 10:10
You want us you keep interrupting.
{Caller} - 10:23
Take your name please.
{Agent} - 10:24
I do not take that sort of response to that sort of communication back. I am trying to help you here and I am giving you the options of how I'm going to send the claim form through to you.
{Caller} - 10:32
Can you hear me?00:02
Good morning. Shawn speaking, how can I help you.
{Caller} - 00:06
Yes, good morning yesterday, I reported an emergency issue on the road. I requested claim form, but unfortunately case you couldn't find any record of works be on the on the roof. I was given a reference number and told to call back today, because you could send an email to investigate. The fact they find out what was going on. I wanted to confirm if you have any updates yes.
{Agent} - 00:37
Right do you have a reference number for that at all.
{Caller} - 00:40
Yes, it's 707192.
{Agent} - 00:43

{Agent} - 01:38
Okay, so if you let me just have a look here.
{Agent} - 01:54
Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.

{Agent} - 01:38
Okay, so if you let me just have a look here.
{Agent} - 01:54
Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council. If you are if you are requesting a claim then obviously I can put that we can send you a claim form out you have read about you have gone onto the website on the claim for damages and you have read about the highways act on there. Now affects your claim.
{Caller} - 05:03
Willing to send the internet council Oliver.
{Caller} - 05:28
Affect my claim.
{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18
Right, so why you can't we can't what.
{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.
{Agent} - 07:09

{Caller} - 07:18

{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.

{Caller} - 10:32
Can you hear me?00:02
Good morning. Shawn speaking, how can I help you.
{Caller} - 00:06
Yes, good morning yesterday, I reported an emergency issue on the road. I requested claim form, but unfortunately case you couldn't find any record of works be on the on the roof. I was given a reference number and told to call back today, because you could send an email to investigate. The fact they find out what was going on. I wanted to confirm if you have any updates yes.
{Agent} - 00:37
Right do you have a reference number for that at all.
{Caller} - 00:40
Yes, it's 707192.
{Agent} - 00:43
707.
{Agent} - 00:51
707192.
{Agent} - 01:07
Can you confirm your name please?
{Caller} - 01:09
Ian Palmer.
{Agent} - 01:11
Okay, and your post code.
{Caller} - 01:14
Bravo alpha 2 2 5 delta delta.
{Agent} - 01:38
Okay, so if you let me just have a look here.
{Agent} - 01:54
Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council. If you are if you are requesting a claim then obviously I can put that we can send you a claim form out you have read about you have gone onto the website on the claim for damages and you have read about the highways act on there. Now affects your claim.
{Caller} - 05:03
Willing to send the internet council Oliver.
{Caller} - 05:28
Affect my claim.
{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18
Right, so why you can't we can't what.
{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.
{Agent} - 07:09
Right. Okay, so you have a really bad line. I do apologise is I can't hear you very very clearly I did get some of that we can send out a claims form.
{Caller} - 07:18
Can you hear me now?
{Agent} - 07:19
I can hear you better now obviously with the situation is a day.
{Caller} - 07:22
Okay, I will I will people should I repeat what I said.
{Agent} - 07:26
Yes, if you want to repeat it please yes.
{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.
{Caller} - 09:06
Okay, and well, I don't have access to email. So what reason adjustments can they make because of that.
{Agent} - 09:12
Alright, so you have provided us with an email address for that to be sent out to you.
{Caller} - 09:17
As I said I'm a phone call yesterday again, which is recorded for training the marketing purposes. I said I do not have access to that email apart from once a week when my carer available and I put on there. That my junior case.

I will sorry you are talking over the top of me and if you are going to refer to me and that sort of match the matter I will have to terminate this call.
{Caller} - 10:10
You want us you keep interrupting.
{Caller} - 10:23
Take your name please.
{Agent} - 10:24

{Caller} - 10:32
Can you hear me?00:02
Good morning. Shawn speaking, how can I help you.
{Caller} - 00:06
Yes, good morning yesterday, I reported an emergency issue on the road. I requested claim form, but unfortunately case you couldn't find any record of works be on the on the roof. I was given a reference number and told to call back today, because you could send an email to investigate. The fact they find out what was going on. I wanted to confirm if you have any updates yes.
{Agent} - 00:37
Right do you have a reference number for that at all.
{Caller} - 00:40
Yes, it's 707192.
{Agent} - 00:43
707.
{Agent} - 00:51
707192.
{Agent} - 01:07
Can you confirm your name please?
{Caller} - 01:09
Ian Palmer.
{Agent} - 01:11
Okay, and your post code.
{Caller} - 01:14
Bravo alpha 2 2 5 delta delta.
{Agent} - 01:38
Okay, so if you let me just have a look here.
{Agent} - 01:54
Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council. If you are if you are requesting a claim then obviously I can put that we can send you a claim form out you have read about you have gone onto the website on the claim for damages and you have read about the highways act on there. Now affects your claim.
{Caller} - 05:03
Willing to send the internet council Oliver.
{Caller} - 05:28
Affect my claim.
{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18
Right, so why you can't we can't what.
{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.
{Agent} - 07:09
Right. Okay, so you have a really bad line. I do apologise is I can't hear you very very clearly I did get some of that we can send out a claims form.
{Caller} - 07:18
Can you hear me now?
{Agent} - 07:19

{Caller} - 07:22
Okay, I will I will people should I repeat what I said.
{Agent} - 07:26
Yes, if you want to repeat it please yes.
{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there.

Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36

{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.
{Caller} - 09:06
Okay, and well, I don't have access to email. So what reason adjustments can they make because of that.
{Agent} - 09:12
Alright, so you have provided us with an email address for that to be sent out to you.
{Caller} - 09:17
As I said I'm a phone call yesterday again, which is recorded for training the marketing purposes. I said I do not have access to that email apart from once a week when my carer available and I put on there. That my junior case.

Oh, I'm sorry, if I'm sorry, I am listening to you and I'm not interrupting you and sorry. If you are if you are going if you are going to refer to me in that manner. I will sorry you are talking over the top of me and if you are going to refer to me and that sort of match the matter I will have to terminate this call.
{Caller} - 10:10
You want us you keep interrupting.
{Caller} - 10:23
Take your name please.
{Agent} - 10:24
I do not take that sort of response to that sort of communication back. I am trying to help you here and I am giving you the options of how I'm going to send the claim form through to you.
{Caller} - 10:32
Can you hear me?00:02
Good morning. Shawn speaking, how can I help you.
{Caller} - 00:06
Yes, good morning yesterday, I reported an emergency issue on the road. I requested claim form, but unfortunately case you couldn't find any record of works be on the on the roof. I was given a reference number and told to call back today, because you could send an email to investigate. The fact they find out what was going on. I wanted to confirm if you have any updates yes.
{Agent} - 00:37
Right do you have a reference number for that at all.
{Caller} - 00:40
Yes, it's 707192.
{Agent} - 00:43
707.
{Agent} - 00:51
707192.
{Agent} - 01:07
Can you confirm your name please?
{Caller} - 01:09
Ian Palmer.
{Agent} - 01:11
Okay, and your post code.
{Caller} - 01:14
Bravo alpha 2 2 5 delta delta.
{Agent} - 01:38
Okay, so if you let me just have a look here.
{Agent} - 01:54
Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council.

Now affects your claim.
{Caller} - 05:03

{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10

{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18

{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.

If you are if you are requesting a claim then obviously I can put that we can send you a claim form out you have read about you have gone onto the website on the claim for damages and you have read about the highways act on there. Now affects your claim.
{Caller} - 05:03

{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18
Right, so why you can't we can't what.
{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.
{Agent} - 07:09
Right. Okay, so you have a really bad line. I do apologise is I can't hear you very very clearly I did get some of that we can send out a claims form.
{Caller} - 07:18
Can you hear me now?
{Agent} - 07:19
I can hear you better now obviously with the situation is a day.
{Caller} - 07:22
Okay, I will I will people should I repeat what I said.
{Agent} - 07:26
Yes, if you want to repeat it please yes.
{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.
{Caller} - 09:06
Okay, and well, I don't have access to email. So what reason adjustments can they make because of that.
{Agent} - 09:12
Alright, so you have provided us with an email address for that to be sent out to you.
{Caller} - 09:17
As I said I'm a phone call yesterday again, which is recorded for training the marketing purposes. I said I do not have access to that email apart from once a week when my carer available and I put on there. That my junior case.
{Agent} - 09:28
Right, so it can be posted out to you for you to be able to see it can be posted out to you to which which case it would be if he is posted out to you then it'll be posted to your home address.
{Caller} - 09:40
Can you hear me? Okay.
{Agent} - 09:44
I'm sorry, yes, I can hear you. Okay. So we are giving you we are giving you the options that you see the post it out to you or if these emailed out to you.
{Caller} - 09:45
Hello, can you hear me? Okay.
{Caller} - 09:51
Yeah, it's just that it's just that I'm very, sorry, you keep interrupting me and I'm wondering if that's because you can't he really because of the telephone or if it's just because you're being rude, I don't know which one it is.
{Agent} - 10:03
Oh, I'm sorry, if I'm sorry, I am listening to you and I'm not interrupting you and sorry. If you are if you are going if you are going to refer to me in that manner. I will sorry you are talking over the top of me and if you are going to refer to me and that sort of match the matter I will have to terminate this call.
{Caller} - 10:10
You want us you keep interrupting.
{Caller} - 10:23
Take your name please.
{Agent} - 10:24
I do not take that sort of response to that sort of communication back. I am trying to help you here and I am giving you the options of how I'm going to send the claim form through to you.
{Caller} - 10:32
Can you hear me?00:02
Good morning. Shawn speaking, how can I help you.
{Caller} - 00:06
Yes, good morning yesterday, I reported an emergency issue on the road. I requested claim form, but unfortunately case you couldn't find any record of works be on the on the roof. I was given a reference number and told to call back today, because you could send an email to investigate. The fact they find out what was going on. I wanted to confirm if you have any updates yes.
{Agent} - 00:37
Right do you have a reference number for that at all.
{Caller} - 00:40
Yes, it's 707192.
{Agent} - 00:43
707.
{Agent} - 00:51
707192.
{Agent} - 01:07
Can you confirm your name please?
{Caller} - 01:09
Ian Palmer.
{Agent} - 01:11
Okay, and your post code.
{Caller} - 01:14
Bravo alpha 2 2 5 delta delta.
{Agent} - 01:38
Okay, so if you let me just have a look here.
{Agent} - 01:54
Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council.

Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council. If you are if you are requesting a claim then obviously I can put that we can send you a claim form out you have read about you have gone onto the website on the claim for damages and you have read about the highways act on there. Now affects your claim.
{Caller} - 05:03
Willing to send the internet council Oliver.
{Caller} - 05:28
Affect my claim.
{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18
Right, so why you can't we can't what.
{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.
{Agent} - 07:09

{Caller} - 07:18

{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance.

Good morning. Shawn speaking, how can I help you.
{Caller} - 00:06
Yes, good morning yesterday, I reported an emergency issue on the road. I requested claim form, but unfortunately case you couldn't find any record of works be on the on the roof. I was given a reference number and told to call back today, because you could send an email to investigate. The fact they find out what was going on. I wanted to confirm if you have any updates yes.
{Agent} - 00:37
Right do you have a reference number for that at all.
{Caller} - 00:40
Yes, it's 707192.
{Agent} - 00:43

Bravo alpha 2 2 5 delta delta.
{Agent} - 01:38
Okay, so if you let me just have a look here.
{Agent} - 01:54
Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council. If you are if you are requesting a claim then obviously I can put that we can send you a claim form out you have read about you have gone onto the website on the claim for damages and you have read about the highways act on there. Now affects your claim.
{Caller} - 05:03
Willing to send the internet council Oliver.
{Caller} - 05:28
Affect my claim.
{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18
Right, so why you can't we can't what.
{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.
{Agent} - 07:09
Right. Okay, so you have a really bad line. I do apologise is I can't hear you very very clearly I did get some of that we can send out a claims form.
{Caller} - 07:18
Can you hear me now?
{Agent} - 07:19

Okay, I will I will people should I repeat what I said.
{Agent} - 07:26

{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.
{Caller} - 09:06

{Agent} - 09:12

I will sorry you are talking over the top of me and if you are going to refer to me and that sort of match the matter I will have to terminate this call.
{Caller} - 10:10
You want us you keep interrupting.
{Caller} - 10:23

{Caller} - 10:32
Can you hear me?00:02
Good morning. Shawn speaking, how can I help you.
{Caller} - 00:06
Yes, good morning yesterday, I reported an emergency issue on the road. I requested claim form, but unfortunately case you couldn't find any record of works be on the on the roof. I was given a reference number and told to call back today, because you could send an email to investigate. The fact they find out what was going on. I wanted to confirm if you have any updates yes.
{Agent} - 00:37
Right do you have a reference number for that at all.
{Caller} - 00:40
Yes, it's 707192.
{Agent} - 00:43
707.
{Agent} - 00:51
707192.
{Agent} - 01:07
Can you confirm your name please?
{Caller} - 01:09
Ian Palmer.
{Agent} - 01:11
Okay, and your post code.
{Caller} - 01:14
Bravo alpha 2 2 5 delta delta.
{Agent} - 01:38
Okay, so if you let me just have a look here.
{Agent} - 01:54
Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council. If you are if you are requesting a claim then obviously I can put that we can send you a claim form out you have read about you have gone onto the website on the claim for damages and you have read about the highways act on there. Now affects your claim.
{Caller} - 05:03
Willing to send the internet council Oliver.
{Caller} - 05:28
Affect my claim.
{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18
Right, so why you can't we can't what.
{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.
{Agent} - 07:09
Right. Okay, so you have a really bad line. I do apologise is I can't hear you very very clearly I did get some of that we can send out a claims form.
{Caller} - 07:18
Can you hear me now?
{Agent} - 07:19
I can hear you better now obviously with the situation is a day.
{Caller} - 07:22
Okay, I will I will people should I repeat what I said.
{Agent} - 07:26
Yes, if you want to repeat it please yes.
{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.
{Caller} - 09:06
Okay, and well, I don't have access to email. So what reason adjustments can they make because of that.
{Agent} - 09:12
Alright, so you have provided us with an email address for that to be sent out to you.

{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.
{Caller} - 09:06
Okay, and well, I don't have access to email. So what reason adjustments can they make because of that.
{Agent} - 09:12
Alright, so you have provided us with an email address for that to be sent out to you.
{Caller} - 09:17
As I said I'm a phone call yesterday again, which is recorded for training the marketing purposes. I said I do not have access to that email apart from once a week when my carer available and I put on there. That my junior case.
{Agent} - 09:28

Oh, I'm sorry, if I'm sorry, I am listening to you and I'm not interrupting you and sorry. If you are if you are going if you are going to refer to me in that manner. I will sorry you are talking over the top of me and if you are going to refer to me and that sort of match the matter I will have to terminate this call.
{Caller} - 10:10
You want us you keep interrupting.
{Caller} - 10:23
Take your name please.
{Agent} - 10:24
I do not take that sort of response to that sort of communication back. I am trying to help you here and I am giving you the options of how I'm going to send the claim form through to you.
{Caller} - 10:32
Can you hear me?00:02
Good morning. Shawn speaking, how can I help you.
{Caller} - 00:06
Yes, good morning yesterday, I reported an emergency issue on the road. I requested claim form, but unfortunately case you couldn't find any record of works be on the on the roof. I was given a reference number and told to call back today, because you could send an email to investigate. The fact they find out what was going on. I wanted to confirm if you have any updates yes.
{Agent} - 00:37
Right do you have a reference number for that at all.
{Caller} - 00:40
Yes, it's 707192.
{Agent} - 00:43
707.
{Agent} - 00:51
707192.
{Agent} - 01:07
Can you confirm your name please?
{Caller} - 01:09
Ian Palmer.
{Agent} - 01:11
Okay, and your post code.
{Caller} - 01:14
Bravo alpha 2 2 5 delta delta.
{Agent} - 01:38
Okay, so if you let me just have a look here.
{Agent} - 01:54
Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council. If you are if you are requesting a claim then obviously I can put that we can send you a claim form out you have read about you have gone onto the website on the claim for damages and you have read about the highways act on there. Now affects your claim.
{Caller} - 05:03
Willing to send the internet council Oliver.
{Caller} - 05:28
Affect my claim.
{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18

{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.

One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18
Right, so why you can't we can't what.
{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.
{Agent} - 07:09
Right. Okay, so you have a really bad line. I do apologise is I can't hear you very very clearly I did get some of that we can send out a claims form.
{Caller} - 07:18
Can you hear me now?
{Agent} - 07:19
I can hear you better now obviously with the situation is a day.
{Caller} - 07:22
Okay, I will I will people should I repeat what I said.
{Agent} - 07:26
Yes, if you want to repeat it please yes.
{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.
{Caller} - 09:06
Okay, and well, I don't have access to email. So what reason adjustments can they make because of that.
{Agent} - 09:12
Alright, so you have provided us with an email address for that to be sent out to you.
{Caller} - 09:17
As I said I'm a phone call yesterday again, which is recorded for training the marketing purposes. I said I do not have access to that email apart from once a week when my carer available and I put on there. That my junior case.
{Agent} - 09:28
Right, so it can be posted out to you for you to be able to see it can be posted out to you to which which case it would be if he is posted out to you then it'll be posted to your home address.
{Caller} - 09:40

{Agent} - 09:44
I'm sorry, yes, I can hear you. Okay. So we are giving you we are giving you the options that you see the post it out to you or if these emailed out to you.

Yeah, it's just that it's just that I'm very, sorry, you keep interrupting me and I'm wondering if that's because you can't he really because of the telephone or if it's just because you're being rude, I don't know which one it is.
{Agent} - 10:03
Oh, I'm sorry, if I'm sorry, I am listening to you and I'm not interrupting you and sorry. If you are if you are going if you are going to refer to me in that manner. I will sorry you are talking over the top of me and if you are going to refer to me and that sort of match the matter I will have to terminate this call.
{Caller} - 10:10
You want us you keep interrupting.
{Caller} - 10:23
Take your name please.
{Agent} - 10:24
I do not take that sort of response to that sort of communication back. I am trying to help you here and I am giving you the options of how I'm going to send the claim form through to you.
{Caller} - 10:32
Can you hear me?00:02
Good morning. Shawn speaking, how can I help you.
{Caller} - 00:06
Yes, good morning yesterday, I reported an emergency issue on the road. I requested claim form, but unfortunately case you couldn't find any record of works be on the on the roof. I was given a reference number and told to call back today, because you could send an email to investigate. The fact they find out what was going on. I wanted to confirm if you have any updates yes.
{Agent} - 00:37
Right do you have a reference number for that at all.
{Caller} - 00:40
Yes, it's 707192.
{Agent} - 00:43
707.
{Agent} - 00:51
707192.
{Agent} - 01:07
Can you confirm your name please?
{Caller} - 01:09
Ian Palmer.
{Agent} - 01:11
Okay, and your post code.
{Caller} - 01:14
Bravo alpha 2 2 5 delta delta.
{Agent} - 01:38
Okay, so if you let me just have a look here.
{Agent} - 01:54
Alright, so if you could just explain to me what seems to be the issue because of just reading the notes on here and I'm just trying to work out what seems to be the problem. If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.
{Caller} - 02:06
Well yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.
{Agent} - 02:35
So I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.
{Caller} - 03:03
Right, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.
{Agent} - 03:15
Right. Okay so.
{Caller} - 03:15
I offered the office photographs yesterday at the work that has been on the eighth.
{Agent} - 03:25
Right.
{Agent} - 03:30
So what's happened is that the the rocks is that he's actually doing work on there and they have planed the site. So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.
{Agent} - 03:46
So it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.
{Caller} - 03:55
Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57
let me have a quick look on this.
{Agent} - 05:03
I'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council.

Now affects your claim.

Right, I don't know what you want me to say.
{Agent} - 03:59
Okay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.
{Caller} - 04:19
It was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.
{Agent} - 04:55
Okay. So
{Agent} - 04:57

{Agent} - 05:03

{Agent} - 05:30
You have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.
{Caller} - 05:42
At one moment one moment
{Caller} - 05:45
just.
{Caller} - 05:48
One moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.
{Agent} - 05:52
Right the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.
{Caller} - 06:10
I can't.
{Agent} - 06:14
So you you can't.
{Agent} - 06:18
Right, so why you can't we can't what.
{Caller} - 06:22
I won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.
{Agent} - 06:31
Right, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.
{Caller} - 06:36
Oh I see.
{Caller} - 06:51
They could.
{Caller} - 06:57
See that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.
{Agent} - 07:09
Right. Okay, so you have a really bad line. I do apologise is I can't hear you very very clearly I did get some of that we can send out a claims form.
{Caller} - 07:18
Can you hear me now?
{Agent} - 07:19
I can hear you better now obviously with the situation is a day.
{Caller} - 07:22
Okay, I will I will people should I repeat what I said.
{Agent} - 07:26
Yes, if you want to repeat it please yes.
{Caller} - 07:29
Because I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.
{Agent} - 08:09
What was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.
{Caller} - 09:06
Okay, and well, I don't have access to email. So what reason adjustments can they make because of that.
{Agent} - 09:12
Alright, so you have provided us with an email address for that to be sent out to you.
{Caller} - 09:17

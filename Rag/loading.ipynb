There were \\ncountless industry and academic publications describing what  Data \\nScience is and  why  we should care, but very little information was \\navailable to explain how to make use of data as a resource. We find \\nthat situation to be just as true today as we did two years ago, when \\nwe created the first edition of the field guide. \\nAt Booz Allen Hamilton, we built an industry-leading team of \\nData Scientists. Over the course of hundreds of analytic challenges \\nfor countless clients, we’ve unraveled the DNA of Data Science. \\nMany people have put forth their thoughts on single aspects of \\nData Science. We believe we can offer a broad perspective on the \\nconceptual models, tradecraft, processes and culture of Data Science \\n– the what , the why, the who and the how.  Companies with strong \\nData Science teams often focus on a single class of problems – graph \\nalgorithms for social network analysis, and recommender models for \\nonline shopping are two notable examples. Booz Allen is different. \\nIn our role as consultants, we support a diverse set of government \\nand commercial clients across a variety of domains. This allows us to \\nuniquely understand the DNA of Data Science. \\nOur goal in creating The Field Guide to Data Science was to  \\ncapture what we have learned and to share it broadly. The field  \\nof Data Science has continued to advance since we first released  \\nthe field guide. As a result, we decided to release this second edition, \\nincorporating a few new and important concepts. We also added \\ntechnical depth and richness that we believe practitioners will  \\nfind useful. \\nWe want this effort to continue driving forward the science and \\nart of Data Science.\\nThis field guide came from the passion our team feels for its \\nwork. It is not a textbook nor is it a superficial treatment. \\nSenior leaders will walk away with a deeper understanding of \\nthe concepts at the heart of Data Science. Practitioners will \\nadd to their toolbox. We hope everyone will enjoy the journey.››'),\n",

So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.\\n{Agent} - 03:46\\nSo it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.\\n{Caller} - 03:55\\nRight, I don't know what you want me to say.\\n{Agent} - 03:59\\nOkay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.\\n{Caller} - 04:19\\nIt was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road. I had to cross and that popped in my tires.\\n{Agent} - 04:55\\nOkay. So\\n{Agent} - 04:57\\nlet me have a quick look on this.\\n{Agent} - 05:03\\nI'm not right I'm not. Okay. I'm not right so. Okay so now you would be sent into the council. If you are if you are requesting a claim then obviously I can put that we can send you a claim form out you have read about you have gone onto the website on the claim for damages and you have read about the highways act on there. Now affects your claim.\\n{Caller} - 05:03\\nWilling to send the internet council Oliver.\\n{Caller} - 05:28\\nAffect my claim.\\n{Agent} - 05:30\\nYou have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.\\n{Caller} - 05:42\\nAt one moment one moment\\n{Caller} - 05:45\\njust.\\n{Caller} - 05:48\\nOne moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.\\n{Agent} - 05:52\\nRight the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.\\n{Caller} - 06:10\\nI can't.\\n{Agent} - 06:14\\nSo you you can't.\\n{Agent} - 06:18\\nRight, so why you can't we can't what.\\n{Caller} - 06:22\\nI won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.\\n{Agent} - 06:31\\nRight, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.\\n{Caller} - 06:36\\nOh I see.\\n{Caller} - 06:51\\nThey could.\\n{Caller} - 06:57\\nSee that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.\\n{Agent} - 07:09\\nRight. Okay, so you have a really bad line. I do apologise is I can't hear you very very clearly I did get some of that we can send out a claims form.\\n{Caller} - 07:18\\nCan you hear me now?\\n{Agent} - 07:19\\nI can hear you better now obviously with the situation is a day.\\n{Caller} - 07:22\\nOkay, I will I will people should I repeat what I said.\\n{Agent} - 07:26\\nYes, if you want to repeat it please yes.\\n{Caller} - 07:29\\nBecause I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.\\n{Agent} - 08:09\\nWhat was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.\\n{Caller} - 09:06\\nOkay, and well, I don't have access to email. So what reason adjustments can they make because of that.\\n{Agent} - 09:12\\nAlright, so you have provided us with an email address for that to be sent out to you.\\n{Caller} - 09:17\\nAs I said I'm a phone call yesterday again, which is recorded for training the marketing purposes. I said I do not have access to that email apart from once a week when my carer available and I put on there. That my junior case.\\n{Agent} - 09:28\\nRight, so it can be posted out to you for you to be able to see it can be posted out to you to which which case it would be if he is posted out to you then it'll be posted to your home address.\\n{Caller} - 09:40\\nCan you hear me? Okay.\\n{Agent} - 09:44\\nI'm sorry, yes, I can hear you. Okay. So we are giving you we are giving you the options that you see the post it out to you or if these emailed out to you.\\n{Caller} - 09:45\\nHello, can you hear me? Okay.\\n{Caller} - 09:51\\nYeah, it's just that it's just that I'm very, sorry, you keep interrupting me and I'm wondering if that's because you can't he really because of the telephone or if it's just because you're being rude, I don't know which one it is.\\n{Agent} - 10:03\\nOh, I'm sorry, if I'm sorry, I am listening to you and I'm not interrupting you and sorry. If you are if you are going if you are going to refer to me in that manner. I will sorry you are talking over the top of me and if you are going to refer to me and that sort of match the matter I will have to terminate this call.\\n{Caller} - 10:10\\nYou want us you keep interrupting.\\n{Caller} - 10:23\\nTake your name please.\\n{Agent} - 10:24\\nI do not take that sort of response to that sort of communication back. I am trying to help you here and I am giving you the options of how I'm going to send the claim form through to you.\\n{Caller} - 10:32\\nCan you hear me?00:02\\nGood morning.

If you could just tell me what the what the problem is.\\n{Caller} - 02:06\\nWell yesterday, the lady said, I she said it was a happy come back then but issues contracted to conduct work and it was a K C C we're on a record of it and they didn't and she said that she was gonna send somebody within two hours to investigate what was going on and yeah, I was told to callback today.\\n{Agent} - 02:35\\nSo I don't know why they told you to call back today. Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.\\n{Caller} - 03:03\\nRight, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.\\n{Agent} - 03:15\\nRight.

So they'll take obviously that means they've taken the top level off for the for the work for the area to be resurfaced.\\n{Agent} - 03:46\\nSo it's in the process of being re surface at the moment, so that's the reason why it's uneven.\\n{Caller} - 03:55\\nRight, I don't know what you want me to say.\\n{Agent} - 03:59\\nOkay, so that's the information that I can see on here is the fact that there's that one and Stuart's went out to attend the site and the carriage been claimed out by rocks, but it's not yet been resurfaced. So, therefore, they claimed it to put to put in you out of to resurface to resurface the road.\\n{Caller} - 04:19\\nIt was in a very dangerous stays there was where the the the lower payment was which has got tactile paid along there was a big hole or that thing too on Monday and it was also significant amount of agree left all over the over the pavement and on the road.

Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.\\n{Caller} - 03:03\\nRight, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.\\n{Agent} - 03:15\\nRight.

Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.\\n{Caller} - 03:03\\nRight, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.\\n{Agent} - 03:15\\nRight.

Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.\\n{Caller} - 03:03\\nRight, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.\\n{Agent} - 03:15\\nRight.

Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.\\n{Caller} - 03:03\\nRight, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.\\n{Agent} - 03:15\\nRight.

Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.\\n{Caller} - 03:03\\nRight, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.\\n{Agent} - 03:15\\nRight.

Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.\\n{Caller} - 03:03\\nRight, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.\\n{Agent} - 03:15\\nRight.

Cause what happened is that they were getting contact with you once they've done the investigation there is a 28 day it was put through as an emergency, but that's been changed over now it wasn't classed as an emergency has been changed so we do say 28 days for them to be able to investigate and get back to you they are normally a lot quicker than that, but they're still they're still looking into it.\\n{Caller} - 03:03\\nRight, but unfortunately like play the damages to stay into my mobility scooter.\\n{Agent} - 03:15\\nRight.

Now affects your claim.\\n{Caller} - 05:03\\nWilling to send the internet council Oliver.\\n{Caller} - 05:28\\nAffect my claim.\\n{Agent} - 05:30\\nYou have read the highways act, though these information on there for you to be able to read I can send you out a form that's not a problem. If you if you do wish it obviously if you go onto Kenny dog U K and go onto damage to your vehicle and read the section on there.\\n{Caller} - 05:42\\nAt one moment one moment\\n{Caller} - 05:45\\njust.\\n{Caller} - 05:48\\nOne moment you said it would affect my claim why does it affect my.\\n{Agent} - 05:52\\nRight the information is on there is for you to read and how it affects your claim. When you put your claim in so therefore the information about the information on there about the highways and so if you were to read that then you'll see that is information that you do need to read if you wish to put in the claim.\\n{Caller} - 06:10\\nI can't.\\n{Agent} - 06:14\\nSo you you can't.\\n{Agent} - 06:18\\nRight, so why you can't we can't what.\\n{Caller} - 06:22\\nI won't be able to be if you're telling me I have to read at before I can submit the claim, but I won't be able to.\\n{Agent} - 06:31\\nRight, so I'm not saying you have not saying you have to read that we are advising you to read that as part of you submitting a claim. Obviously if you're saying that you're saying that you why why can't you read that particular section just out of curiosity. If you if you are asking for a claim to be written for you to be able to write out and send off to us. Obviously the case that it runs it runs in conjunction with your your claim.\\n{Caller} - 06:36\\nOh I see.\\n{Caller} - 06:51\\nThey could.\\n{Caller} - 06:57\\nSee that yesterday, that's why I'm calling back to a site.\\n{Agent} - 07:09\\nRight. Okay, so you have a really bad line. I do apologise is I can't hear you very very clearly I did get some of that we can send out a claims form.\\n{Caller} - 07:18\\nCan you hear me now?\\n{Agent} - 07:19\\nI can hear you better now obviously with the situation is a day.\\n{Caller} - 07:22\\nOkay, I will I will people should I repeat what I said.\\n{Agent} - 07:26\\nYes, if you want to repeat it please yes.\\n{Caller} - 07:29\\nBecause I have a disability which prevents me from doing so which is covered by section. 202010. I said on the telephone call yesterday, but because of that I was making a re adjustment request and subsequently my preference of indication was already over the telephone that's why I'm calling back today. Could you confirm I wasn't on the road? I was on the pavements. I was wondering mobility scooter which is described as an invalid carriage. Unfortunately, could you confirm I have looked at the the form online, but it explicitly mentioned the motor vehicle it doesn't cover my mobility scooter does it.\\n{Agent} - 08:09\\nWhat was I don't know which form you look that because the form the form was actually be emailed to you. So I'm not sure which form you've actually looked at you won't you the form will be sent directly to us to be able to fill in you can put on there. That if it's if it is a mobility scooter you can clear you can kind of put on there. That. It is a mobility scooter and then obviously, you're feeling the relevant information because remember that he does not come back to us. It does go to a liability team so it does go to us set of insurance claim advisors and solicitors he'll be looking into the looking into the issue, but it's the same as his any any other form of claim that's put in through an insurance. So they'll be the ones who deal with it you will not be ourselves so just to let you aware that when he is emailed out to you and you do fill it in and you send it back to the liabilities. We will not be able to answer any further questions regarding it you would need to get in contact with the liability team by email for them to be able to come back to you.\\n{Caller} - 09:06\\nOkay, and well, I don't have access to email. So what reason adjustments can they make because of that.\\n{Agent} - 09:12\\nAlright, so you have provided us with an email address for that to be sent out to you.\\n{Caller} - 09:17\\nAs I said I'm a phone call yesterday again, which is recorded for training the marketing purposes. I said I do not have access to that email apart from once a week when my carer available and I put on there. That my junior case.\\n{Agent} - 09:28\\nRight, so it can be posted out to you for you to be able to see it can be posted out to you to which which case it would be if he is posted out to you then it'll be posted to your home address.\\n{Caller} - 09:40\\nCan you hear me? Okay.\\n{Agent} - 09:44\\nI'm sorry, yes, I can hear you. Okay. So we are giving you we are giving you the options that you see the post it out to you or if these emailed out to you.\\n{Caller} - 09:45\\nHello, can you hear me? Okay.\\n{Caller} - 09:51\\nYeah, it's just that it's just that I'm very, sorry, you keep interrupting me and I'm wondering if that's because you can't he really because of the telephone or if it's just because you're being rude, I don't know which one it is.\\n{Agent} - 10:03\\nOh, I'm sorry, if I'm sorry, I am listening to you and I'm not interrupting you and sorry. If you are if you are going if you are going to refer to me in that manner. I will sorry you are talking over the top of me and if you are going to refer to me and that sort of match the matter I will have to terminate this call.\\n{Caller} - 10:10\\nYou want us you keep interrupting.\\n{Caller} - 10:23\\nTake your name please.\\n{Agent} - 10:24\\nI do not take that sort of response to that sort of communication back. I am trying to help you here and I am giving you the options of how I'm going to send the claim form through to you.\\n{Caller} - 10:32\\nCan you hear me?\")]"

LangGraphVersionsOverviewRelease PolicyPackagesv0.2LangChain v0.2astream_events v2ChangesSecurityTutorialsBuild a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) AppOn this pageBuild a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) AppOne of the most powerful applications enabled by LLMs is sophisticated question-answering (Q&A) chatbots. These are applications that can answer questions about specific source information. These applications use a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG.This tutorial will show how to build a simple Q&A application\\nover a text data source. Along the way we’ll go over a typical Q&A\\narchitecture and highlight additional resources for more advanced Q&A techniques. We’ll also see\\nhow LangSmith can help us trace and understand our application.\\nLangSmith will become increasingly helpful as our application grows in\\ncomplexity.If you\\'re already familiar with basic retrieval, you might also be interested in\\nthis high-level overview of different retrieval techinques.What is RAG?\\u200bRAG is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional data.LLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were trained on. If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model\\'s cutoff date, you need to augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it needs. The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting it into the model prompt is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).LangChain has a number of components designed to help build Q&A applications, and RAG applications more generally. Note: Here we focus on Q&A for unstructured data. If you are interested for RAG over structured data, check out our tutorial on doing question/answering over SQL data.Concepts\\u200bA typical RAG application has two main components:Indexing: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. This usually happens offline.Retrieval and generation: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model.The most common full sequence from raw data to answer looks like:Indexing\\u200bLoad: First we need to load our data. This is done with Document Loaders.Split: Text splitters break large Documents into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and for passing it in to a model, since large chunks are harder to search over and won\\'t fit in a model\\'s finite context window.Store: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can later be searched over. This is often done using a VectorStore and Embeddings model.Retrieval and generation\\u200bRetrieve: Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from storage using a Retriever.Generate: A ChatModel / LLM produces an answer using a prompt that includes the question and the retrieved dataSetup\\u200bJupyter Notebook\\u200bThis guide (and most of the other guides in the documentation) uses Jupyter notebooks and assumes the reader is as well. Jupyter notebooks are perfect for learning how to work with LLM systems because oftentimes things can go wrong (unexpected output, API down, etc) and going through guides in an interactive environment is a great way to better understand them.This and other tutorials are perhaps most conveniently run in a Jupyter notebook. See here for instructions on how to install.Installation\\u200bThis tutorial requires these langchain dependencies:PipCondapip install langchain langchain_community langchain_chromaconda install langchain langchain_community langchain_chroma -c conda-forgeFor more details, see our Installation guide.LangSmith\\u200bMany of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls.\\nAs these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent.\\nThe best way to do this is with LangSmith.After you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=\"true\"export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=\"...\"Or, if in a notebook, you can set them with:import getpassimport osos.environ[\"LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2\"] = \"true\"os.environ[\"LANGCHAIN_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()Preview\\u200bIn this guide we’ll build an app that answers questions about the content of a website. The specific website we will use is the LLM Powered Autonomous\\nAgents blog post\\nby Lilian Weng, which allows us to ask questions about the contents of\\nthe post.We can create a simple indexing pipeline and RAG chain to do this in ~20\\nlines of code:OpenAIAnthropicAzureGoogleCohereNVIDIAFireworksAIGroqMistralAITogetherAIpip install -qU langchain-openaiimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAIllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\")pip install -qU langchain-anthropicimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropicllm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")pip install -qU langchain-openaiimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_openai import AzureChatOpenAIllm = AzureChatOpenAI(    azure_endpoint=os.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT\"],    azure_deployment=os.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME\"],    openai_api_version=os.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION\"],)pip install -qU langchain-google-vertexaiimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_google_vertexai import ChatVertexAIllm = ChatVertexAI(model=\"gemini-1.5-flash\")pip install -qU langchain-cohereimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"COHERE_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_cohere import ChatCoherellm = ChatCohere(model=\"command-r-plus\")pip install -qU langchain-nvidia-ai-endpointsimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"NVIDIA_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain import ChatNVIDIAllm = ChatNVIDIA(model=\"meta/llama3-70b-instruct\")pip install -qU langchain-fireworksimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"FIREWORKS_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_fireworks import ChatFireworksllm = ChatFireworks(model=\"accounts/fireworks/models/llama-v3p1-70b-instruct\")pip install -qU langchain-groqimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"GROQ_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_groq import ChatGroqllm = ChatGroq(model=\"llama3-8b-8192\")pip install -qU langchain-mistralaiimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"MISTRAL_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_mistralai import ChatMistralAIllm = ChatMistralAI(model=\"mistral-large-latest\")pip install -qU langchain-openaiimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"TOGETHER_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAIllm = ChatOpenAI(    base_url=\"https://api.together.xyz/v1\",    api_key=os.environ[\"TOGETHER_API_KEY\"],    model=\"mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1\",)import bs4from langchain import hubfrom langchain_chroma import Chromafrom langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoaderfrom langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParserfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthroughfrom langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddingsfrom langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter# Load, chunk and index the contents of the blog.loader = WebBaseLoader(    web_paths=(\"https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\",),    bs_kwargs=dict(        parse_only=bs4.SoupStrainer(            class_=(\"post-content\", \"post-title\", \"post-header\")        )    ),)docs = loader.load()text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings())# Retrieve and generate using the relevant snippets of the blog.retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()prompt = hub.pull(\"rlm/rag-prompt\")def format_docs(docs):    return \"\\\\n\\\\n\".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs)rag_chain = (    {\"context\": retriever | format_docs, \"question\": RunnablePassthrough()}    | prompt    | llm    | StrOutputParser())rag_chain.invoke(\"What is Task Decomposition?\")API Reference:WebBaseLoader | StrOutputParser | RunnablePassthrough | OpenAIEmbeddings | RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\\'Task Decomposition is a process where a complex task is broken down into smaller, simpler steps or subtasks.

Indexing: Split\\u200bOur loaded document is over 42k characters long. This is too long to fit\\nin the context window of many models. Even for those models that could\\nfit the full post in their context window, models can struggle to find\\ninformation in very long inputs.To handle this we’ll split the Document into chunks for embedding and\\nvector storage. This should help us retrieve only the most relevant bits\\nof the blog post at run time.In this case we’ll split our documents into chunks of 1000 characters\\nwith 200 characters of overlap between chunks. The overlap helps\\nmitigate the possibility of separating a statement from important\\ncontext related to it. We use the\\nRecursiveCharacterTextSplitter,\\nwhich will recursively split the document using common separators like\\nnew lines until each chunk is the appropriate size. This is the\\nrecommended text splitter for generic text use cases.We set add_start_index=True so that the character index at which each\\nsplit Document starts within the initial Document is preserved as\\nmetadata attribute “start_index”.from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplittertext_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(    chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200, add_start_index=True)all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)len(all_splits)API Reference:RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter66len(all_splits[0].page_content)969all_splits[10].metadata{\\'source\\': \\'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\\', \\'start_index\\': 7056}Go deeper\\u200bTextSplitter: Object that splits a list of Documents into smaller\\nchunks.

Indexing: Store\\u200bNow we need to index our 66 text chunks so that we can search over them\\nat runtime. The most common way to do this is to embed the contents of\\neach document split and insert these embeddings into a vector database\\n(or vector store). When we want to search over our splits, we take a\\ntext search query, embed it, and perform some sort of “similarity”\\nsearch to identify the stored splits with the most similar embeddings to\\nour query embedding. The simplest similarity measure is cosine\\nsimilarity —\\xa0we measure the cosine of the angle between each pair of\\nembeddings (which are high dimensional vectors).We can embed and store all of our document splits in a single command\\nusing the Chroma\\nvector store and\\nOpenAIEmbeddings\\nmodel.from langchain_chroma import Chromafrom langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddingsvectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings())API Reference:OpenAIEmbeddingsGo deeper\\u200bEmbeddings: Wrapper around a text embedding model, used for converting\\ntext to embeddings.Docs: Detailed documentation on how to use embeddings.Integrations: 30+ integrations to choose from.Interface: API reference for the base interface.VectorStore: Wrapper around a vector database, used for storing and\\nquerying embeddings.Docs: Detailed documentation on how to use vector stores.Integrations: 40+ integrations to choose from.Interface: API reference for the base interface.This completes the Indexing portion of the pipeline. At this point\\nwe have a query-able vector store containing the chunked contents of our\\nblog post. Given a user question, we should ideally be able to return\\nthe snippets of the blog post that answer the question.4. Retrieval and Generation: Retrieve\\u200bNow let’s write the actual application logic. We want to create a simple\\napplication that takes a user question, searches for documents relevant\\nto that question, passes the retrieved documents and initial question to\\na model, and returns an answer.First we need to define our logic for searching over documents.\\nLangChain defines a\\nRetriever interface\\nwhich wraps an index that can return relevant Documents given a string\\nquery.The most common type of Retriever is the\\nVectorStoreRetriever,\\nwhich uses the similarity search capabilities of a vector store to\\nfacilitate retrieval. Any VectorStore can easily be turned into a\\nRetriever with VectorStore.as_retriever():retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_type=\"similarity\", search_kwargs={\"k\": 6})retrieved_docs = retriever.invoke(\"What are the approaches to Task Decomposition?\")len(retrieved_docs)6print(retrieved_docs[0].page_content)Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.Go deeper\\u200bVector stores are commonly used for retrieval, but there are other ways\\nto do retrieval, too.Retriever: An object that returns Documents given a text queryDocs: Further\\ndocumentation on the interface and built-in retrieval techniques.\\nSome of which include:MultiQueryRetriever generates variants of the input\\nquestion\\nto improve retrieval hit rate.MultiVectorRetriever instead generates\\nvariants of the\\nembeddings,\\nalso in order to improve retrieval hit rate.Max marginal relevance selects for relevance and\\ndiversity\\namong the retrieved documents to avoid passing in duplicate\\ncontext.Documents can be filtered during vector store retrieval using\\nmetadata filters, such as with a Self Query\\nRetriever.Integrations: Integrations\\nwith retrieval services.Interface:\\nAPI reference for the base interface.5.

This is often done using techniques like \"Chain of Thought\" or \"Tree of Thoughts\", which instruct a model to \"think step by step\" and transform large tasks into multiple simple tasks. Task decomposition can be prompted in a model, guided by task-specific instructions, or influenced by human inputs.Let\\'s dissect the LCEL to understand what\\'s going on.First: each of these components (retriever, prompt, llm, etc.) are instances of Runnable. This means that they implement the same methods-- such as sync and async .invoke, .stream, or .batch-- which makes them easier to connect together. They can be connected into a RunnableSequence-- another Runnable-- via the | operator.LangChain will automatically cast certain objects to runnables when met with the | operator. Here, format_docs is cast to a RunnableLambda, and the dict with \"context\" and \"question\" is cast to a RunnableParallel. The details are less important than the bigger point, which is that each object is a Runnable.Let\\'s trace how the input question flows through the above runnables.As we\\'ve seen above, the input to prompt is expected to be a dict with keys \"context\" and \"question\". So the first element of this chain builds runnables that will calculate both of these from the input question:retriever | format_docs passes the question through the retriever, generating Document objects, and then to format_docs to generate strings;RunnablePassthrough() passes through the input question unchanged.That is, if you constructedchain = (    {\"context\": retriever | format_docs, \"question\": RunnablePassthrough()}    | prompt)Then chain.invoke(question) would build a formatted prompt, ready for inference. (Note: when developing with LCEL, it can be practical to test with sub-chains like this.)The last steps of the chain are llm, which runs the inference, and StrOutputParser(), which just plucks the string content out of the LLM\\'s output message.You can analyze the individual steps of this chain via its LangSmith\\ntrace.Built-in chains\\u200bIf preferred, LangChain includes convenience functions that implement the above LCEL. We compose two functions:create_stuff_documents_chain specifies how retrieved context is fed into a prompt and LLM. In this case, we will \"stuff\" the contents into the prompt -- i.e., we will include all retrieved context without any summarization or other processing. It largely implements our above rag_chain, with input keys context and input-- it generates an answer using retrieved context and query.create_retrieval_chain adds the retrieval step and propagates the retrieved context through the chain, providing it alongside the final answer. It has input key input, and includes input, context, and answer in its output.from langchain.chains import create_retrieval_chainfrom langchain.chains.combine_documents import create_stuff_documents_chainfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplatesystem_prompt = (    \"You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. \"    \"Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer \"    \"the question.

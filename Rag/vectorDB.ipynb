The manner in which the advantage is defined \\nis through improved decision-making. A former colleague liked to \\ndescribe data-informed decision making like this: If you have perfect \\ninformation or zero information then your task is easy – it is in between \\nthose two extremes that the trouble begins. What he was highlighting is \\nthe stark reality that whether or not information is available, decisions \\nmust be made.\\nThe way organizations make decisions has been evolving for half a \\ncentury. Before the introduction of Business Intelligence, the only \\noptions were gut instinct, loudest voice, and best argument. Sadly, this \\nmethod still exists today, and in some pockets it is the predominant \\nmeans by which the organization acts. Take our advice and never, ever \\nwork for such a company! \\nFortunately for our economy, most organizations began to inform \\ntheir decisions with real information through the application of \\nsimple statistics. Those that did it well were rewarded; those that did \\nnot failed. We are outgrowing the ability of simple stats to keep pace \\nwith market demands, however. The rapid expansion of available data \\nand the tools to access and make use of the data at scale are enabling \\nfundamental changes to the way organizations make decisions. \\nData Science is required to maintain competitiveness in the \\nincreasingly data-rich environment. Much like the application of \\nsimple statistics, organizations that embrace Data Science will be \\nrewarded while those that do not will be challenged to keep pace. As \\nmore complex, disparate datasets become available, the chasm between \\nthese groups will only continue to widen. The figure, The Business \\nImpacts of Data Science, highlights the value awaiting organizations \\nthat embrace Data Science.\\nTHE FIELD GUIDE to  D AT A  S C I E N C E\\n')]"

What he was highlighting is \\nthe stark reality that whether or not information is available, decisions \\nmust be made.\\nThe way organizations make decisions has been evolving for half a \\ncentury. Before the introduction of Business Intelligence, the only \\noptions were gut instinct, loudest voice, and best argument. Sadly, this \\nmethod still exists today, and in some pockets it is the predominant \\nmeans by which the organization acts.

The manner in which the advantage is defined \\nis through improved decision-making. A former colleague liked to \\ndescribe data-informed decision making like this: If you have perfect \\ninformation or zero information then your task is easy – it is in between \\nthose two extremes that the trouble begins. What he was highlighting is \\nthe stark reality that whether or not information is available, decisions \\nmust be made.\\nThe way organizations make decisions has been evolving for half a \\ncentury. Before the introduction of Business Intelligence, the only \\noptions were gut instinct, loudest voice, and best argument. Sadly, this \\nmethod still exists today, and in some pockets it is the predominant \\nmeans by which the organization acts. Take our advice and never, ever \\nwork for such a company! \\nFortunately for our economy, most organizations began to inform \\ntheir decisions with real information through the application of \\nsimple statistics. Those that did it well were rewarded; those that did \\nnot failed. We are outgrowing the ability of simple stats to keep pace \\nwith market demands, however. The rapid expansion of available data \\nand the tools to access and make use of the data at scale are enabling \\nfundamental changes to the way organizations make decisions. \\nData Science is required to maintain competitiveness in the \\nincreasingly data-rich environment. Much like the application of \\nsimple statistics, organizations that embrace Data Science will be \\nrewarded while those that do not will be challenged to keep pace. As \\nmore complex, disparate datasets become available, the chasm between \\nthese groups will only continue to widen. The figure, The Business \\nImpacts of Data Science, highlights the value awaiting organizations \\nthat embrace Data Science.\\nTHE FIELD GUIDE to  D AT A  S C I E N C E\\n'),\n",

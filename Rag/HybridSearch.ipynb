This is \\naccomplished through the creation of data products, which provide \\nactionable information without exposing decision makers to the \\nunderlying data or analytics (e.g., buy/sell strategies for financial \\ninstruments, a set of actions to improve product yield, or steps to \\nimprove product marketing).\\nPerforming Data Science requires the extraction of timely, actionable \\ninformation from diverse data sources to drive data products. \\nExamples of data products include answers to questions such as: \\n“Which of my products should I advertise more heavily to increase \\nprofit? How can I improve my compliance program, while reducing \\ncosts? What manufacturing process change will allow me to build a \\nbetter product?” The key to answering these questions is: understand \\nthe data you have and what the data inductively tells you.\\n \\n» Data Product\\nA data product provides actionable \\ninformation without exposing \\ndecision makers to the underlying \\ndata or analytics. Examples include:\\n• Movie Recommendations      \\n• Weather Forecasts\\n• Stock Market Predictions\\n• Production Process \\nImprovements\\n• Health Diagnosis\\n• Flu Trend Predictions\\n• Targeted Advertising\\nRead this for additional background:\\nThe term Data Science appeared \\nin the computer science literature \\nthroughout the 1960s-1980s. \\nIt was not until the late 1990s \\nhowever, that the field as we \\ndescribe it here, began to  \\nemerge from the statistics and \\ndata mining communities  \\n(e.g., [2] and [3]). Data Science \\nwas first introduced as an \\nindependent discipline in 2001.[4] \\nSince that time, there have been \\ncountless articles advancing the \\ndiscipline, culminating with \\nData Scientist being declared the \\nsexiest job of the 21st century.[5] \\nWe established our first Data \\nScience team at Booz Allen \\nin 2010. It began as a natural \\nextension of our Business \\nIntelligence and cloud \\ninfrastructure development  \\nwork. We saw the need for a  \\nnew approach to distill value \\nfrom our clients’ data. We \\napproached the problem \\nwith a multidisciplinary \\nteam of computer scientists, \\nmathematicians and domain \\nexperts. They immediately \\nproduced new insights and \\nanalysis paths, solidifying the \\nvalidity of the approach. Since \\nthat time, our Data Science  \\nteam has grown to 250 staff \\nsupporting dozens of clients \\nacross a variety of domains.  \\nThis breadth of experience \\nprovides a unique perspective  \\non the conceptual models, \\ntradecraft, processes and  \\nculture of Data Science.'),\n",

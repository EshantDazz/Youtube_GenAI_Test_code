There were \\ncountless industry and academic publications describing what Data \\nScience is and why we should care, but very little information was \\navailable to explain how to make use of data as a resource. We find \\nthat situation to be just as true today as we did two years ago, when \\nwe created the first edition of the field guide. At Booz Allen Hamilton, we built an industry-leading team of \\nData Scientists. Over the course of hundreds of analytic challenges \\nfor countless clients, we’ve unraveled the DNA of Data Science. Many people have put forth their thoughts on single aspects of \\nData Science. We believe we can offer a broad perspective on the \\nconceptual models, tradecraft, processes and culture of Data Science \\n– the what, the why, the who and the how. Companies with strong \\nData Science teams often focus on a single class of problems – graph \\nalgorithms for social network analysis, and recommender models for \\nonline shopping are two notable examples. Booz Allen is different. In our role as consultants, we support a diverse set of government \\nand commercial clients across a variety of domains. This allows us to \\nuniquely understand the DNA of Data Science. Our goal in creating The Field Guide to Data Science was to  \\ncapture what we have learned and to share it broadly. The field  \\nof Data Science has continued to advance since we first released  \\nthe field guide. As a result, we decided to release this second edition, \\nincorporating a few new and important concepts. We also added \\ntechnical depth and richness that we believe practitioners will  \\nfind useful. We want this effort to continue driving forward the science and \\nart of Data Science. This field guide came from the passion our team feels for its \\nwork. It is not a textbook nor is it a superficial treatment. Senior leaders will walk away with a deeper understanding of \\nthe concepts at the heart of Data Science. Practitioners will \\nadd to their toolbox.'),\n",

Regardless of how an \\neffort starts, political headwinds often present more of a challenge \\nthan solving any technical hurdles. To help battle the headwinds, it is \\nimportant to generate momentum and prove the value a Data Science \\nteam can provide. The best way to achieve this is usually through \\na Data Science prototype or proof of concept. Proofs of concepts \\ncan generate the critical momentum needed to jump start any Data \\nScience Capability Four qualities, in particular, are essential for every \\nData Science prototype:\\n1. Organizational Buy-in: A prototype will only succeed if the \\nindividuals involved believe in it and are willing to do what \\nthey can to make it successful. A good way to gauge interest \\nis to meet with the middle managers; their views are usually \\nindicative of the larger group. 2. Clear ROI: Before choosing a prototype problem, ensure that \\nthe ROI of the analytic output can be clearly and convincingly \\ndemonstrated for both the project and the organization as a \\nwhole. This outcome typically requires first reaching consensus \\non how the ROI will be determined and measured, so that the \\nbenefit can be quantified. 3. Necessary Data: Before selecting a prototype, you must first \\ndetermine exactly what data is needed, whether it will actually \\nbe available, and what it will cost in terms of time and expense. It is important to note that organizations do not need all the \\npossible data – they can still create successful analytics even \\nwith some gaps. 4. Limited Complexity and Duration:  The problem addressed \\nby the prototype should achieve a balance between being too \\ncomplex and too easy. Organizations new to Data Science often \\ntry to show its value with highly complex projects. However, \\nthe greater the complexity, the greater the risk of failure. At the \\nsame time, if the problem is too easy to solve, senior leaders \\nand others in the organization may not see the need for Data \\nScience. Look for efforts that could benefit from large datasets, \\nor bringing together disparate datasets that have never been \\ncombined before, as opposed to those that require complex \\nanalytic approaches. In these cases, there is often low-hanging \\nfruit that can lead to significant value for the organization.'),\n",

In statistics \\nthis is referred to as Type I error. As scientists, we are always \\non the lookout for a new or \\ninteresting breakthrough that \\ncould explain a phenomenon. We hope to see a pattern in our \\ndata that explains something \\nor that can give us an answer. The primary goal of hypothesis \\ntesting is to limit Type I error. This is accomplished by using \\nsmall α values. For example, \\na α value of 0.05 states that \\nthere is a 1 in 20 chance that \\nthe test will show that there \\nis something signiﬁcant when \\nin actuality there isn’t. This \\nproblem compounds when \\ntesting multiple hypotheses. When running multiple \\nhypothesis tests, we are likely \\nto encounter Type I error. As \\nmore data becomes available \\nfor analysis, Type I error \\nneeds to be controlled. One of my projects required \\ntesting the difference between \\nthe means of two microarray \\ndata samples. Microarray \\ndata contains thousands of \\nmeasurements but is limited \\nin the number of observations. A common analysis approach \\nis to measure the same genes \\nunder different conditions. If \\nthere is a signiﬁcant enough \\ndifference in the amount of \\ngene expression between the \\ntwo samples, we can say that \\nthe gene is correlated with a \\nparticular phenotype. One way \\nto do this is to take the mean of \\neach phenotype for a particular \\ngene and formulate a hypothesis \\nto test whether there is a \\nsigniﬁcant difference between \\nthe means. Given that we were \\nrunning thousands of these tests \\nat α = 0.05, we found several \\ndifferences that were signiﬁcant. The problem was that some \\nof these could be caused by \\nrandom chance.'),\n",

You can’t do without \\nit, but you rarely give it much thought. Feature engineering is the process by which one establishes the \\nrepresentation of data in the context of an analytic approach. It is the \\nfoundational skill in Data Science. Without feature engineering, it \\nwould not be possible to understand and represent the world through \\na mathematical model. Feature engineering is a challenging art. Like \\nother arts, it is a creative process that manifests uniquely in each \\nData Scientist. It will be influenced substantially by the scientist’s \\nexperiences, tastes and understanding of the field. When faced with the problem of feature engineering, there are \\nseveral paths that one may initially take. Generally speaking, better \\nfeatures can be developed with more knowledge of the domain. One \\napproach to feature engineering is to begin by describing smaller \\nelements of the domain and continuously constructing more intricate \\nfeatures as the model becomes more complex. These more complicated \\nfeatures can be defined by considering other attributes of the domain, \\naggregating features together into different groups or using advanced \\nstatistical and mathematical techniques to devise new features. The \\nultimate judge in this process is the performance of the machine \\nlearning algorithm which makes decisions based on this feature vector. Consider the example of email spam classification. Because the \\ndomain is a set of emails, one possible choice of an initial feature \\nvector is the integer array that counts the number of times a \\ngiven word appears in the email. This is called the \"bag of words\" \\nassumption, where the order that words appear in a text is ignored. If an algorithm with this feature vector does not adequately \\ndistinguish between spam and non-spam emails, a feature could  \\nbe added that counts the number of misspelled words in the text. This new feature uses the spam recognition domain knowledge that \\nasserts many spam emails misspell words. These misspelled words  \\nalert filters saying that the existence of certain words automatically \\nlabel an email as spam. If this new feature is not enough, there are  \\nstill additional features to be considered such as whether or not a  \\nfirst or last name is used in the email.'),\n",

Our Approach\\nThe commercial aviation industry is rich \\nin ﬂight operations data, much of which \\nis publicly available through government \\nwebsites and a few subscription \\nvendors. Booz Allen Hamilton leveraged \\nthese sources to gather over 4 TB of \\ndata detailing tarmac and airspace \\ncongestion, weather conditions, network \\neffects, Trafﬁc Management Initiatives, \\nand airline and aircraft-speciﬁc \\nattributes for every commercial ﬂight \\ndeparting from U.S. airports between \\n2008 and 2012. This data included over 50 \\nmillion ﬂights and around 100 variables \\nfor each ﬂight. The data included \\ncomposite variables (e.g. incoming ﬂight \\ndelay) that were constructed from the \\nraw data to capture relevant dynamics \\nof ﬂight operations. Data acquisition, \\nprocessing, quality control, and accuracy \\nbetween disparate datasets were \\nimportant steps during this process. The team applied supervised learning \\nalgorithms to develop Bayesian Belief \\nNetwork (BBN) models to predict ﬂight \\ndeparture deviation. The most critical \\nsteps in model development were the \\nselection of optimal algorithms to \\ndiscretize model variables, and the \\nselection of appropriate machine learning \\ntechniques to learn the model from the \\ndata. The team followed information \\ntheory principles to discretize model \\nvariables to maximize the model’s \\npredictive power, and to represent the \\ndata as closely as possible with the \\nleast amount of network complexity. Booz Allen segmented the model \\nvariables into three different categories \\nbased on the time to ﬂight departure: \\n24 hours, 11 hours, and one hour. Certain ﬂight variables could only \\nbe known for speciﬁc pre-departure \\ntimes. For example, the tarmac and \\nairspace congestion variables for \\na ﬂight are only known just before \\nthe ﬂight, and hence those variables \\nfeature only in the one hour category.
